To earn a bit of play.</p><p>Oh, you have learned to prod and poke<br /> At tortured puzzles from the Pole.<br /> You know what word the rover spoke.<br /> You fixed it when the printer broke.<br /> And now it’s time to take a soak<br /> And lounge at this atoll.</p><p>These five long years have left their mark,<br /> And R&amp;R will hit the spot.<br /> Put down the Scala and the Spark,<br /> Put <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Lisp</code>y <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">car</code>s all into park,<br /> And watch a dolphin (or a shark),<br /> From deck chairs, on a yacht.</p><p>No goals, this time, to work toward<br /> No consoles going ‘beep’.<br /> No goblins swinging mace and sword,<br /> Just beaches, and a king’s reward.<br /> (I’ll gladly get the leaderboard<br /> While you can get some sleep!)</p><h3 id="day-2-secure"><a href="https://www.adventofcode.com/2020/day/2">Day 2</a>: Secure</h3><p>Said the suit on the right to the suit on the left,<br /> “There’s a problem we execs must fix. <br /> Our employees use passwords not strong or secure;<br /> We’ve tried warnings, but none of it sticks.”</p><p>Said the suit on the left to the suit on the right,<br /> “Then if warnings won’t do, we need more.<br /> The incredible secrets of Tobaggan Inc.,<br /> Must not reach the sled rental next door.”</p><p>Said the suit in the front to the suits on the side,<br /> “Let our action be swift and precise.<br /> We’ll make rules and restrictions on passwords henceforth. <br /> And no letter shall enter one twice.”</p><p>Said the suit in the back to the suits up ahead,<br /> In a PowerPoint made on the spot,<br /> “We will limit the letters, point A and point B.<br /> One must have it, the other must not.”</p><p>Then the suits all around all stood up and shook hands.<br /> Memoranda were typed and prepared.<br /> But the suit in the center, he stayed at his seat,<br /> To consider the meeting he’d chaired.</p><p>Then the suit in the center, he slowly stood up,<br /> And focused his gaze on the rest.<br /> “This policy’s <em>better</em> than ours was before, <br /> But it certainly is not the <em>best</em>.”</p><p>“A good policy’s only the half of the thing,”<br /> Said the center suit. “Still insecure!<br /> Why, if Sled Rental Inc. got a hold of this rule,<br /> They could get to our servers for sure!”</p><p>All the suits in the room, save the center, recoiled<br /> At the thought of so dreadful a fate.<br /> All those snow coefficients, the tests and the codes,<br /> The schematics, served up on a plate.</p><p>“So, the key to security,” cautioned the suit,<br /> “Lies in randomly changing the rules.<br /> If the sled rental shop tries out <em>last</em> fortnight’s codes,<br /> During <em>this</em> one, we’ll play them like fools.”</p><p>Said the suit on the left to the suit standing up <br /> (All the other suits scared as could be)<br /> “But then how, Senior Suit, can bimonthly rules work,<br /> When we meet just one month every three?”</p><p>Then the suit in the center, he sighed with a smile.<br /> And said, “Then we’ll make them right here.<br /> And we’ll type up a memo and send it around<br /> With the passwords and rules for the year.”</p><p>In the evening, the suits filed out through the door,<br /> Corporate policy written anew.<br /> And the suit in the center sat down at his screen,<br /> And, for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">password</code>, he typed <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hunter2</code>.</p><h3
