skills to the test.</p><p>I start by reading the problem statement<br /> And breaking it down into bits,<br /> Thinking about how to approach it<br /> And coming up with a plan that fits.</p><p>Then I write some code to solve it<br /> Testing and debugging as I go,<br /> Making sure it’s efficient and correct<br /> And ready for the next challenge, oh no.</p><p>In the end, I submit my solution<br

thought there was still some room for improvement.</em></p><p>As my character hunts through the jungle<br /> On a quest for a grove with a star,<br /> I myself, though I err and I bungle,<br /> Hunt for challenge, and that’s what these are.</p><p>For each problem, I start by not reading:<br /> Take a glance, make a guess at the rest.<br /> There’s no time to slow down while I’m speeding<br /> And attempting to code with the best.</p><p>Then I write down some code and submit it,<br /> Inefficient? Ha! <em>Sluggish</em>, I’ll say.<br /> And the untested code, I admit it <br /> Sometimes works the first try, like today.</p><p>In the end, I’ve had fun and competed,<br /> Having raced through the thing like a master,<br /> And with two shiny stars now completed,<br /> I can’t help but think I could be faster.</p><h3 id="day-5-safety-first-in-last-out"><a href="https://www.adventofcode.com/2022/day/5">Day 5</a>: Safety First (In Last Out)</h3><p>A couple years ago, when it was winter,<br /> And Cratemover Two Thousand was the latest,<br /> When somebody was <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2017/day/1">busy with the printer</a><br /> And someone else took <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/13"><em>Breakout!</em></a> for a playtest,<br /> The wooden crates we had (and feared would splinter),<br /> Held presents, and the top crate was the greatest.<br /> Inside - what child wouldn’t love to smack it? -<br /> Was bubble wrap with bubble wrap to pack it.</p><p>If salt goes bad, with what can it be seasoned?<br /> If bug reports don’t work, how would you know it?<br /> The wrap was safe on top (or so we reasoned),<br /> And surely safer than the stuff below it.<br /> I said “We wouldn’t want the crate to squeeze” and<br /> “It’s earned the place of honor” said the poet,<br /> And so our finest gift, our precious jewel<br /> Sat high atop the stack, as if to rule.</p><p>The tallest stack, of course, sticks out the tallest,<br /> And that became a problem when a blizzard -<br /> The worst we had in years, in fact, the squall-est -<br /> Blew forth as if cast at us by a wizard.<br /> (The wizard’s just one guess, though it’s a small list;<br /> “Don’t irk him, just in case” still sometimes is heard).<br /> We thought our stack of crates was doing well,<br /> Until at last, on Christmas Eve, it fell.</p><p>Alas! The bubble wrap had all been frozen<br /> Before it fell from such a risky height.<br /> The wind on top was strong; if we had chosen<br /> Some slightly smaller stacks, it’d be all right.<br /> It burst and shattered like it had a hose in;<br /> No children got to play with it that night.<br /> We’re careful, now, when getting cargo loaded.<br /> We still remember what the ice and snow did.</p><h3 id="day-6-a-letter-back-home"><a href="https://www.adventofcode.com/2022/day/6">Day 6</a>: A Letter Back Home</h3><div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><code><table class="rouge-table"><tbody><tr><td class="rouge-gutter gl"><pre class="lineno">1

Face east. Five steps, at least.<br /> Now, where’d you think you’ll go?”</p><p>I turned and stepped one pace, then two,<br /> But three was one too far.<br /> “You’re off the edge, I do allege!<br /> So, where’d you think you are?”</p><p>“The other side!” I said to him,<br /> Upon that fateful day.<br /> I didn’t think it <em>had</em> a brink<br /> So that’s the only way.</p><p>And then he asked - my heart is weak -<br /> “I mean, <em>exactly</em> where?<br /> “If I start <em>here</em>” - he gestured near -<br /> “Will I go <em>there</em>, or <em>there</em>?”</p><p>The mathematics circled in<br /> Like vultures round the dying.<br /> I’d love to say I knew a way,<br /> But sadly, I’d be lying.</p><p>“On endless planes”, the student said,<br /> With just a gentle sigh,<br /> “You always know to start at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">O</code><br /> And go to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">y</code>.”</p><p>“The distances and paths and trails<br /> Are trivial to tell.<br /> Old Euclid knew, and I know too,<br /> And now you know as well.”</p><p>“But if the world were <em>not</em> a plane”,<br /> He asked the flat-Earth rube,<br /> “Could you create and calculate<br /> “The distance on a <strong>cube</strong>?”</p><p>The world is flat!
