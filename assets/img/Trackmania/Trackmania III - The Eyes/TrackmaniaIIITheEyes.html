The goal throughout this project has been to make a bot that learns as fast as a human does, so we wanted the program to learn from the kind of graphics that human players use, eventually deciding to give our bot an image input with a resolution of 1600x900, at 30 frames per second.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In the end, we proved that this goal is possible, but a full implementation was beyond us.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">## Image Acquisition</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We need to use each frame for two purposes: driving and training. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">**Driving**: It is obviously important for the program to know where it is going, so the program needs to decide which way to steer the car, every 33,000 &mu;s. Thus, we need to get the image to the neural network for processing in much less than 33,000 &mu;s, because the program will need time to process the image, make a decision about which keys to press, and send the keypress decision to Trackmania.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">**Training**: The program needs to learn from prior runs, minutes or hours or days from now. &nbsp;If we want to ever generalize and have a program that can learn new maps, the network will need periodic reminders of previous maps, or else risk overfitting to whatever map it happens to be playing right this second. You can think of this as the memory of past races. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, we need an image, and we need the image in two places. &nbsp;We need it **wherever the neural network is**, and we need it **wherever a large amount of data can be stored for a long time**.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">### Screenshots from Disk</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The easiest framegrab method to implement is also the most obvious one. &nbsp;Trackmania 2020 has a built-in screenshot function accessible with a single keypress (F12), which saves a picture of the game to a specific folder on the hard drive. &nbsp;Failing that, most operating systems have functions (usually mapped to `Prt Sc`) which take a picture of the entire screen and save it the same way. &nbsp;So, the easiest way to get the pictures of Trackmania is to press a screenshot button continuously (using whatever technique you&#39;re using to send keypresses to steer the car), and have your program scan the folder and load any pictures that weren&#39;t there 1/30th of a second ago into the RAM, where your program can use it.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This isn&#39;t as silly an idea as it might seem. &nbsp;If we&#39;re going to be storing large amounts of data for future training, the hard drive is the natural place to store it. &nbsp;And if we&#39;re going to be storing data there eventually, why not put the screenshot there to start with?</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">The primary problem with this approach is that data transfer to and from a hard drive takes a long time. &nbsp;We have 33,000 microseconds for the entire frame-by-frame decision-making process. &nbsp;Preliminary timings for our 1600x900 screen showed that it took on average 16,000 &mu;s to save a screenshot to disk and 21,000 &mu;s to load the screenshot from disk again, for a total of 37,000 microseconds - 112% of our time already gone.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And even that&#39;s a generous estimate; that assumes that the screenshot is taken at the exact moment of a frame update, which we are not (yet) doing anything to ensure. &nbsp;If the screenshots and the game are out of sync with each other, then there could be another delay between 0 and 33,000 &mu;s added on top of that, for an average 52,000 microsecond total delay between when the frame is rendered and when the neural network can even *start* to process the screen for its own decision-making; by the time the network even begins working a frame, the game will have already displayed the next one, and be on the verge of displaying the one after that.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This wouldn&#39;t be a dealbreaker for [10 FPS](https://www.trackmania.ai/blog/posts/pedroai-rl/pedroai-rl.html) or [20 FPS](https://github.com/pb4git/trackmania_rl_public), but for 30 FPS, it&#39;s too much of a delay. &nbsp;Linesight got around this problem by taking tiny screenshots and keeping them all in RAM, but our screenshots are 225 times larger than the 160x120 greyscale images; if we tried to do the same thing and keep full-resolution images in RAM, we would fill up 64 GB of RAM in less than ten minutes.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Obviously, we were going to have to come up with something else. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">### Screengrabs from RAM</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>If we need the screenshot *from* disk, but we first needed to save it *to* disk, it makes sense to ask if we could cut out the middleman. &nbsp;Rust does have crates for this, and the crate we decided to test was [`nvfbc`](</span><span class="c4"><a class="c3" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.rs/nvfbc/latest/nvfbc/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1731694536613635&amp;usg=AOvVaw2ad_lX5gG1Ff9wnWQZYs4z">https://docs.rs/nvfbc/latest/nvfbc/</a></span><span class="c1">); it has the option of viewing the contents of the screen directly from the frame as stored in RAM, with no need for any hard drive reading or writing. &nbsp;The average timing - correct this time - was 1,300 &mu;s.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This is one example that shows why we picked Rust and Linux over the (theoretically easier to work with) Python and Windows. &nbsp;This is a racing game. &nbsp;We wanted to write a program that is *fast*. &nbsp;When the [Linesight project](https://github.com/pb4git/trackmania_rl_public/tree/main) faced the same problem we did and needed to get images from the screen to the neural network quickly, Agade09 found that none of the existing screenshot-to-memory tools in Windows were fast enough to suit the project&#39;s needs, and wrote his own custom library, [DXCam](https://github.com/Agade09/DXcam/tree/NewFeatures), more than twice as fast as any other Windows / Python screenshot tool.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">For a full-sized 1440p resolution, DXCam provided a framegrab rate of 238 FPS, for an average screenshot time of 4,200 &mu;s. &nbsp;A standard 1440p resolution has 2.56x more pixels than a 1600x900 display, so as a first-order approximation we&#39;d expect that to translate to 1,600 &mu;s for our display. &nbsp;We got 1,300 &mu;s right out of the box, without having to write our own library.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">We wrote our own library anyway. &nbsp;But we&rsquo;ll get to that.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden;

a better way would be to have a &#39;Waldo detector&#39; (which determines if Waldo is or is not in a small picture), break the large picture up into many small pictures, and then run the &#39;Waldo detector&#39; on each one of the small pictures.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000;

When you stack these features together, you&rsquo;re able to identify a specific image or feature in an image that is essentially the sum of these things.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">A normal image has three **channels**: one for the intensity of red pixels, one for the intensity of green pixels, and one for the intensity of blue pixels. &nbsp;A convolutional layer will take these three input channels and produce some number of output channels. &nbsp;So, to identify Waldo, you might look for high intensities in the red fuzz channel, white horizontal line channel, blob shape channel, smile shape channel, and flesh color channel, all in the same place.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">And that&rsquo;s the real strength of the convolutional filters: you can do this *over and over*. &nbsp;Take all those channels (red fuzz, white horizontal line, and so forth) that were output by the first convolutional layer, and input them into a second layer. &nbsp;One of the channels output by that second layer might be a &lsquo;Waldo-ness&rsquo; channel, and the intensity of the pixel corresponds to how likely that pixel is to be part of Waldo. &nbsp;Another channel&rsquo;s intensity might represent the &lsquo;car-ness&rsquo; of a given pixel, and another&rsquo;s might represent the &lsquo;tree-ness&rsquo;. &nbsp;Stack these convolutional layers on top of each other, and you can detect higher- and higher-level features of the original image. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s the goal. &nbsp;We want a neural network that can recognize obstacles, and distinguish between surface types, and aim towards finish lines. &nbsp;One layer isn&rsquo;t enough.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">So, how many layers do we need? &nbsp;We have no idea. &nbsp;We&rsquo;re going to see how many we can handle, and go from there.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden;

since it&rsquo;s NVIDIA, the most natural programming language to use to run tensor operations on our GPU is CUDA. &nbsp;One of CUDA&rsquo;s libraries is [`cuDNN`](</span><span class="c4"><a class="c3" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1731694536617956&amp;usg=AOvVaw1CdMrvnoYw3kG1YP6tCu7C">https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn</a></span><span class="c1">), which provides functions for running deep neural networks on a GPU. &nbsp;And, luckily for us, someone [already made a Rust crate giving access to cuDNN](https://github.com/autumnai/rust-ocudnn). &nbsp;All we had to do is figure out how to use it, and how to send tensors to and from the GPU in a format that cuDNN could read.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Even more luckily for us, the same [`nvfbc`](</span><span class="c4"><a class="c3" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.rs/nvfbc/latest/nvfbc/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1731694536618502&amp;usg=AOvVaw1zxSVWOuW8w44XE-1AhQoM">https://docs.rs/nvfbc/latest/nvfbc/</a></span><span class="c1">) crate we used to capture the screen contents from RAM could also capture the screen contents from the internal GPU buffer. &nbsp;The GPU framebuffer itself is protected, and can&rsquo;t be modified by our external program (without getting into memory unsafety stuff that we *really* didn&rsquo;t want to get into), so the `nvfbc` crate uses `rustacuda` to clone the framebuffer into a second tensor in GPU memory. &nbsp;So we could clone it, send it to RAM, and run it through our convolutional neural network.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Interestingly, when we tried to send the framebuffer from the GPU memory to RAM, it was actually slower than the RAM framebuffer capture from earlier; 4,000 &mu;s as opposed to 1,500 &mu;s. &nbsp;This makes a certain degree of sense. &nbsp;The GPU was already sending the frame out, and we had the GPU send the frame out *again*, queued behind the first one. &nbsp;Transfer times between the GPU and RAM aren&rsquo;t fast enough to justify that, and by itself the CUDA capture wouldn&rsquo;t be worth it.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">However, that wasn&rsquo;t why we used `nvfbc`. &nbsp;Transferring the entire framebuffer from CUDA to RAM took 4,000 &mu;s...but the cloning process itself took a mere 170 &mu;s, so small that it was completely invisible when we showed this graph earlier at its full scale. &nbsp;If we captured the framebuffer from GPU memory, and **also** ran the neural network on the GPU, then we had no reason to ever send the framebuffer out of the GPU! &nbsp;We could process the frame completely in the GPU, send nothing but the final few output neurons back to RAM, and get a potentially gigantic speedup.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span style="overflow: hidden;

Astute readers might have wondered how we connected and accessed these arbitrary GPU functions in proprietary libraries. Yes, the `cudnn` crate does indeed handle convolutional layers, and the `nvfbc` crate does indeed allow for framebuffer capture, and the `cuda` crate does indeed allow Rust to do tensor manipulation in GPU memory. &nbsp;All that is true. &nbsp;What we didn&rsquo;t mention is that none of these crates were compatible with each other, and all of them are (as of 2024) nearly a decade old. The Rust [`cudnn` crate](https://github.com/autumnai/rust-cudnn) runs against cuDNN version 3. The current version of cuDNN is 9.5. Almost every single method available in the Rust crate is deprecated, gone, or works very subtly differently in 9.5. Not to worry, the `rust-cuda` crate only needs CUDA 8+, while the current version is 12.6. cuDNN version 3 wants CUDA 7, of course.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">You might see this list and think &ldquo;No problem! &nbsp;Update everything to the latest major version. &nbsp;Surely, theres no way most major functions would be renamed or deprecated in each release&hellip;&rdquo; If you think that way (as we did), you&rsquo;re in for an unpleasant surprise, as we were when we got an error that simply read `Unable to register an OpenGL buffer to a CUDA resource (result: 3) - NVFBC_ERR_CUDA` . What does result 3 mean? What is `NVFBC_ERR_CUDA`? &nbsp;How have the error messages changed from one version to another? Hours of fruitless searching followed. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">To make this work, we had to make our own Foreign Function Interface (FFI) bindings for all three crates ([using `cargo:rustc-link-lib=` in `build.rs`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/build-scripts.html)), and then carefully make higher-level functions to access, transfer, and alter CUDA memory. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s possible - as it always is - that this wasn&rsquo;t necessary, and that there was an easy way to make all three crates talk to each other that we simply didn&rsquo;t know about. &nbsp;But that was the whole problem. &nbsp;The *very first thing we ever did* with GPU programming was making our own interface for four separate libraries not designed to talk to each other. &nbsp;We didn&rsquo;t know what we were doing, couldn&rsquo;t find any examples of people trying to do the same thing, and didn&rsquo;t know where to look</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>The obvious starting point was the NVIDIA documentation, but NVIDIA&rsquo;s documentation is less than ideal. &nbsp;For instance, [the developer overview for cuDNN](</span><span class="c4"><a class="c3" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/cudnn/latest/developer/overview.html&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1731694536622381&amp;usg=AOvVaw2OZnslnIY-3UgzdoVkZ1IL">https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/cudnn/latest/developer/overview.html</a></span><span class="c1">) lists, in the introduction:</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&gt; NVIDIA cuDNN provides highly tuned implementations of operations arising frequently in DNN applications:</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&gt; - Convolution forward and backward, including cross-correlation</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&gt; - **Matrix multiplication**</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">&gt; ...</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>We looked far and wide for this matrix multiplication capability within cuDNN (matrix multiplication being equivalent to a fully-connected linear layer, the type of layer we desperately needed), and we could not find it. &nbsp;NVIDIA&rsquo;s official [&ldquo;Matrix Multiplication Background User&#39;s Guide&rdquo;](</span><span class="c4"><a class="c3" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/performance/dl-performance-matrix-multiplication/index.html&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1731694536623369&amp;usg=AOvVaw1CMH7Ct14_9eo3jfL8oE_U">https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/performance/dl-performance-matrix-multiplication/index.html</a></span><span>) requires cuBLAS, not cuDNN, and the [few](</span><span class="c4"><a class="c3" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/tbennun/cudnn-training/blob/master/lenet.cu&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1731694536623735&amp;usg=AOvVaw3A5FUEePsL60Hw6syFruvE">https://github.com/tbennun/cudnn-training/blob/master/lenet.cu</a></span><span>) [projects](</span><span class="c4"><a class="c3" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/abhishek4747/cudnn-backpropagation/blob/87001f7e4b6e69da01c222a1079a2ba6358897dc/mnistCUDNN.cu%23L37&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1731694536624062&amp;usg=AOvVaw0EohIZIlv8iACGljxOmekx">https://github.com/abhishek4747/cudnn-backpropagation/blob/87001f7e4b6e69da01c222a1079a2ba6358897dc/mnistCUDNN.cu#L37</a></span><span class="c1">) we could find which used cuDNN to make convolutional layers also used cuBLAS to make linear layers.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">But this still doesn&rsquo;t sound too bad. &nbsp;We already got three crates working with each other, so why not add a fourth, and get a `cuBLAS.rs` to add to our `cuda.rs`, `cudnn.rs`, and `nvfbc.rs`? &nbsp;We tried. &nbsp;And for reasons we don&rsquo;t understand, we could not get the cuBLAS foreign function calls to work in Rust, no matter how we massaged or flattened the output of the final convolutional layer. &nbsp;We kept getting memory errors and operation errors we couldn&rsquo;t track down or identify (`DGEMM parameter number 8 had an illegal value`), and so rather than spend more weeks trying to eventually fix that, and rather than abandoning cuBLAS and using a solution we knew was significantly slower than ideal, we did neither, and gave up entirely.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">This seems extreme, but it was inevitable based on how we approached the problem. &nbsp;It took months to get all the other libraries working with each other; calling a custom kernel to convert the 8-bit integers in the image framebuffer into 64-bit floating points took a long time by itself. &nbsp;We went as far as stepping through GPU level functions using a segfault analyzer (we actually made the segfault analyzer segfault at one point). &nbsp;And we - this cannot be stressed enough - *had no idea what we were doing*.</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">## Conclusion</span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">It&rsquo;s hard to know what to say. &nbsp;&lsquo;We gave up&rsquo; is not a particularly satisfying way to end a story, even if it happens to be true. &nbsp;But &lsquo;we gave up, and didn&rsquo;t bother writing about it or telling anyone what happened&rsquo; is in all ways worse. &nbsp;So here we are. We were tempted to write an inspiring bit on how writing about your failures is as important as writing about your successes, but that felt more like an attempt at justifying failure than anything else. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">If there&rsquo;s a lesson to be drawn from this, it&rsquo;s to not let the perfect be the enemy of the good. &nbsp;We made what was the fastest program for GPU convolutional network processing of GPU-generated images that we&rsquo;ve ever heard of, faster even than the Linesight program we&rsquo;ve looked up to all this time. &nbsp;If we&rsquo;d gone in merely wanting something *fast*, we would have been more than satisfied with this. &nbsp;But we weren&rsquo;t going to be satisfied unless we had something *optimal*, and that was just a bridge too far. &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t make the same mistake we did. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s okay for parts of your project to be imperfect. </span></p><p class="c0 c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Because when we accept imperfection, we reduce the friction wearing down our motivation.
