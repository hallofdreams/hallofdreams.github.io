Unlike Dave, I have done some stuff in rust. However I've never actually finished a month of AoC problems, much to my shame. This changes now. 

Dave will be taking on the fun challenge of teaching us rust via error messages, I will be trying something slightly different. One of the issues with AoC is hopping over the cliff between code that "does the thing" and code that actually runs quickly. In the early problems its not a big deal, since generally the leap between an incredible solution and the simplest is a matter of, at most seconds, but as you go into day 25 it starts mattering. So what we'll be doing here is first writing the "obvious" or most natural solution, and bit by bit working towards a more optimized solution. Some days the most natural solution will be the best solution, and on those days we'll explore alternatives, and work out various potential approaches, and see how they work out.
