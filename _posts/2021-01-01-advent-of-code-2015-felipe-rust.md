Unlike Dave, I have done some stuff in rust. However I've never actually finished a month of AoC problems, much to my shame. This changes now. 

Dave will be taking on the fun challenge of teaching us rust via error messages, I will be trying something slightly different. One of the issues with AoC is hopping over the cliff between code that "does the thing" and code that actually runs quickly. In the early problems its not a big deal, since generally the leap between an incredible solution and the simplest is a matter of, at most seconds, but as you go into day 25 it starts mattering. So what we'll be doing here is first writing the "obvious" or most natural solution, and bit by bit working towards a more optimized solution. Some days the most natural solution will be the best solution, and on those days we'll explore alternatives, and work out various potential approaches, and see how they work out. This will be an exercise in learning what the rust complier does, via actually using it. I expect the results will both surprise and shock me. 

# [Day 1](https://www.adventofcode.com/2015/day/1)

The first thing to master when looking at the AoC problems is "what the heck is this asking?" early on, its easy, later you spend a long time looking at it wondering what all the words mean, and pondering the true meaning of "elf". So on a first read, the question seems to be asking, "after looking at the input, what floor will we have ended up on?". But really, that can be translated to "How many ( are there, minus how many )" One way to do this, would be to iterate over everything and count, but we can do so in a much more simple way. Say: 

```rust

fn main(){
        // this is where we import our imput file
        let path = Path::new("../input.txt");
        let display = path.display();

        let mut file = match File::open(&path) {
            Err(why) => panic!("couldn't open {}: {}", display, why),
            Ok(file) => file,
        };
    
        let mut input_string = String::new();
        match file.read_to_string(&mut input_string) {
            Err(why) => panic!("couldn't read {}: {}", display, why),
            Ok(_) => (),
        }

        // Lets time our execution
        let start = Instant::now();
        // Part 1!
        let open_paren = input_string.matches("(").count();
        let close_paren = input_string.matches(")").count();

        print!("Result: {}", open_paren - close_paren);
        let end = start.elapsed().as_micros();
        print!("\n execution time in microseconds {}", end);
}
```

Now for this exercise, I'm not going to be overly concerned with the file opening speed. There are faster, less safe ways of doing it, and we'll look at that in further optimizations, but for today, we're not going to time that. At a glance, this seems great, if we run it, we get... `execution time in microseconds 1900` which is not bad at all. 

We can, and will do better of course, but before we get to that, lets write a bare-bones solution to part 2.

Now reading the problem for part 2, it seems we want the first time that the net value is =1, *counting the first index as 1*. This bit is key and will get us an off by one error if we don't realize it. 

There are two things I realize right away 

1. We can't get away from just iterating now
2. We can bail as soon as the total equals -1 

Lets write that code 

```rust
        let start = Instant::now();
        let mut total = 0;
        for (i, c) in input_string.chars().enumerate() {
            if c == '('   {
                total += 1;
            }
            if c == ')'{
                total -= 1;
            }

            if total == -1 {
                print!("\n Part2: {}", i + 1);
                let end = start.elapsed().as_micros();
                print!("\n execution time in microseconds {}", end);
                return
            }
        }
```

A neat thing dave pointed out to me when I was writing this: if we say "(" that refers to the *string* version of the character, if we say '(' that's the character version. It saves us having to do an annoying conversion, so its good to know. 

There's also something I'm doing that's kind of inneficient to avoid sanitizing the text. I use two ifs, instead of an if...else. My expectation is that will raise the evaluation time slightly, since `branch prediction` will treat is as two separate statements, instead of one branching location. (If my understanding is correct, which it may not be! Yell at me on twitter if I'm wrong) 

Our run time is... 180 microseconds, which is an order of magnitude better than our part 1. 

What the heck is going on?

Well, for one, we can surmise that the default iteration speed is *much* faster than the native `.matches()` method. Hazarding a guess why, its because matches takes a regex, and unwraps the string. The code for it in the [rust source](https://doc.rust-lang.org/src/core/macros/mod.rs.html#219-242) seems pretty straight forward, but its clearly designed for a borader use-case than our specific case. 

We also run it twice, which is less than ideal. 

Looking at our part 2, it makes logical sense that we could jam part 1 in there as well. We lose on the bailing out early bit (since we need to count all the parens), but that means out whole program, instead of iterating over the string three times, needs only iterate over it once.

While we're in there lets also get rid of that annoying if...if and make it an if else, and trust that our input is good. I also added a bit to ensure that we only output the result of p2 once, which didn't impact the speed at all it seemed. 

```rust

use std::fs::File;
use std::io::prelude::*;
use std::path::Path;
use std::time::{Instant};
    

fn main(){
        let start = Instant::now();
        let path = Path::new("../input.txt");
        let display = path.display();

        let mut file = match File::open(&path) {
            Err(why) => panic!("couldn't open {}: {}", display, why),
            Ok(file) => file,
        };
    
        let mut input_string = String::new();
        match file.read_to_string(&mut input_string) {
            Err(why) => panic!("couldn't read {}: {}", display, why),
            Ok(_) => (),
        }
        
        let mut total = 0;
        // print!("{}", input_string);
        let mut seen = false;
        for (i, c) in input_string.chars().enumerate() {
            if c == '('   {
                total += 1;
            }else {
                total -= 1;
            }

            if total == -1 && seen == false{
                print!("\n Part2: {}", i + 1);
                seen = true;
            }
        }
        print!("\n Part1: {}",total);
        let end = start.elapsed().as_micros();
        print!("\n execution time in microseconds {}", end);
}
```

Running it with `cargo run --release` which builds the relase optimized version we get a run time of  141 microseconds. Not at all bad

If we include the file opening... things are less good. It adds almost 90 microseconds, which is non-ideal.
