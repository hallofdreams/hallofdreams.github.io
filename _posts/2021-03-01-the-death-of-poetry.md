## Part I: Art, Gone to Decay

> *Through thy battlements, Newstead, the hollow winds whistle:*  
> *Thou, the hall of my Fathers, art gone to decay;*  
> *In thy once smiling garden, the hemlock and thistle*  
> *Have choak'd up the rose, which late bloom'd in the way.*  
> 
> -- Lord Byron, "On Leaving Newstead Abbey"

Poetry is dead.

Any essay whose opening paragraph consists of a three-word sentence stating a non-obvious universal is either going to be a short essay or is going to spend the next paragraph walking back the provocative sentence into something more nuanced and specific.  The technique is the literary equivalent of clickbait, or a catchy headline being shouted on the street corner, and readers are quite justified to be cautious of essays that start that way.  But, it's somehow an appropriate technique in this context.  Poetry is all about hyperbole and metaphor, about connecting concrete images to abstract ideas; poetry is all about strong, emotionally charged statements which might not be literally true.

Or at any rate, poetry *was* about all those things.  Because, as I mentioned before, it's dead now.

## Part II: Ars Longa, Vita Brevis

> 

For many linguists, Latin is the canonical, go-to example of a dead language.  [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinct_language) lists it as the first example of a 'dead' (as opposed to 'extinct') language, citing the [Oxford Dictionary](http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780199202720.001.0001/acref-9780199202720-e-799?rskey=GN3YxZ&result=801), which says the same thing.  [Global Language Services](https://www.globallanguageservices.co.uk/difference-extinct-language-dead-language/) says that "Latin is probably the most widely known dead language", and just a simple Google search for the phrase "dead language" will turn up 'Latin' as the very first result.

*Putting 'Latin' in bold when it wasn't even searched for is just rubbing salt in the wound.*

For many speakers of Latin, the assertion "Latin is a dead language" is the canonical, go-to example of why linguists don't know what they're talking about.  Reading through the aforementioned search results, you find articles such as ["Look, Latin Is Not Useless, Neither Is It Dead"](https://lithub.com/look-latin-is-not-useless-neither-is-it-dead/), or ["Why Latin Isn't Dead"](http://www.ocscholar.org/humanities/114-why-latin-isn-t-dead.html).  AncientLanguage.com [answers the question "When Did Latin Die?"](https://ancientlanguage.com/when-did-latin-die/) with "never" and ["Is Latin a Dead Language?"](https://ancientlanguage.com/latin-dead-language/) with "no". [Babble.com's article](https://www.babbel.com/en/magazine/fact-vs-fiction-is-latin-a-dead-language) concedes that it is "Technically Dead" in one header, but immediately clarifies "But It's Also Sort Of Alive" in the next.  [/r/Latin](https://old.reddit.com/r/latin/comments/2caeaf/what_is_your_response_to_someone_saying_latin_is/) declares that if Latin is dead, they're all necromancers (which lines up with every horror movie which has ever featured ominous Latin chanting), or will flippantly respond that the language is not dead but simply Roman around.

And these aren't just baseless claims.  On the religious side, Latin is the [official language](http://www.vatican.va/latin/latin_catechism.html) of the largest organized religion in the world, and [more than five hundred Masses](https://www.latinmassdir.org/) are said in Latin every week in the United States.  On the academic side, [classicalstudies.org lists almost a hundred Classics Departments](https://classicalstudies.org/education/graduate-programs-north-america) offering graduate programs in North America for academics, and for hobbyists there are numerous [online communities](https://old.reddit.com/r/latin/), [long-running podcasts](https://quomododicitur.com/), and [YouTube channels](https://www.youtube.com/ScorpioMartianus) devoted to or entirely in Latin.

*Can a language truly be dead if it has an ATM?*

But intuitively, there has to be *some* validity to the declarations that the language is dead, despite all of the religious, academic, and casual devotees.  Latin is clearly in a very different position from [Linear A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_A), which as of 2021 no one on Earth can even decipher, let alone speak.  But it's just as clearly in a very different position from English, the de facto *lingua franca* of most of the world.  The difference can't just be the relatively small number of speakers; [the Icelandic language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icelandic_language) only has around three hundred thousand native speakers compared to English's three hundred million, but Icelandic is completely alive, or at the very least more than 0.1% as alive as English.  It's possible that Latin actually has more speakers worldwide than Icelandic does (depending on how you count), but it's still in a different category.  Dead or not dead, there's something Icelandic is that Latin isn't.

And the difference can't even be the fact that English and Icelandic have native speakers while Latin has none.  Four hundred years ago, Latin still had no native speakers, but its situation was not at all the same as today.  If you were in Europe in the 17th century, and you wanted to understand or contribute to any form of science, you *had* to know Latin; ditto to get into any university or seminary.  Isaac Newton may have been an Englishman, but he called his most important book *Principia Mathematica* and not *Principles of Mathematics* because otherwise, most natural philosophers outside of England itself would not have been able to read it.

That's the biggest qualitative difference: in the 17th century, there was a broad category of things which were not themselves Latin-related, but which could only be done if one knew the language.  In the 21st century, there isn't.  Catholics in 2021 can attend Mass in Latin, but they can just as easily attend Mass in English - even the link from earlier to the Catechism of the Church in Latin [has its URL in English](http://www.vatican.va/latin/latin_catechism.html).  You can buy a copy of *Catus Petasus*, but it's easier to find it by the original title of *Cat in the Hat*.  Ultimately, you can learn the language, but you're ultimately learning the language either a) for its own sake, or b) for necromancy.  Anything else, you can do with a different language.

## Part III: 

> 

A lot of reasonable objections to the assertion that poetry is dead is going to proceed along the same lines.  EventBrite in 2021 [lists over a thousand poetry slam events](https://www.eventbrite.com/d/online/free--events/poetry-slam/) in various locations; [the Poetry Foundation website](https://poetryfoundation.org) has around a million page views a day.  The national ["AP English Literature And Composition](https://apstudents.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-english-literature-and-composition) course has three of its nine core units centered on poetry, and over three hundred thousand students in the US take it every year.  Superhero cartoon franchises have [multiple](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0519646/?ref_=fn_tt_tt_9) [episodes](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0618136/) named after a William Blake poem, TVTropes has an [entire category of haiku summaries](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/namespace_index.php?ns=Haiku), and a [programming competition decided to host a poetry challenge in parallel for the sheer fun of it](https://old.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/wiki/poems4progs).  There's clearly a decent amount of poetry still being read, heard, and written in the English language.  So why call it dead?

## Part IV: The Unnoticed Hands of Time

> *Inter marmoreas Leonorae pendula colles*  
> *Fortunata nimis Machina dicit horas.*  
> *Quas MANIBUS premit illa duas insensa papillas*  
> *Cur mihi sit DIGITO tangere, amata, nefas?*  
> 
> -- Percy Shelley, "In Horologium"

A while back, while reading late at night, I stumbled upon an obscure Percy Shelley poem in an anthology which in English would be titled something like "About the Clock": only four lines long, but in Latin, and in oddly phrased poetic Latin to boot.  There was no translation provided, and a quick Google search turned up no English translations at all, anywhere on the Internet.  So, I got out my Latin book and after twenty minutes painstakingly rendered the first half as:

> Between the mountains, the exceedingly fortunate machine hanging down  
> Tells the marble-like hours to Leonora.  

This was an accurate, literal rendition of the first two lines of the poem, but it told me nothing; knowing what it said didn't give me any clue as to what it *meant*.  So, I messaged Felipe (who was unphased by an unexplained Latin message at half past midnight), and between my Latin book and his fluency in Spanish, we translated the second half over another twenty minutes.  Starting, of course, with the puns. `pendula` is used as a verb meaning `hanging down`, but given the context it also calls to mind an old-fashioned pendulum clock.  `digito` is used the way we'd use the phrase "by a hair's breadth" (to represent two things extremely close together), but its literal meaning of `finger` goes well with the previous line talking about the clocks's hands (`manibus`).  And suddenly, it clicked: this is a dirty poem!  The literal translation, tweaked in light of this, started to make sense.

> That \[the machine\] presses hands, unnoticed, to two breasts -  
> Why is to touch a hair’s breadth away, beloved, a sin to me?

What was Shelley saying?  He'd probably seen (or thought of) a pretty girl wearing a French watch on a locket, and being 17, was of the perfect age to get very jealous of the watch.  So he wrote a poem saying as much.  And, buried as "In Horologium" was (it was only published decades after his death), nobody [except one 1872 anthology writer](https://books.google.com/books?id=Ai_n49Ie0RUC&pg=PA548&lpg=PA548#v=onepage&q&f=false) even bothered speculating about it.  It was immensely satisfying, both to be the first ones to appreciate it in probably a very long time, and to to realize that the thing we were appreciating was silly teenaged humor.

And that's exactly the point - it was satisfying *because we were the only ones to do it*.  It's that gap, those forty minutes of painstaking translation before the "aha!" moment, that marks the difference between a dead language and a living one.  There's a world of emotional connotation that we just don't have, and that we can only reconstruct after the fact.

> The luckiest clock to ever tell the time  
> Adorns the marble mountains of Lenore.  
> *Its* hands caress, and always you ignore –  
> Why is it such a sin, beloved, for mine?  

But that translation lacks the puns with 'pendula' and 'digito', and even aside from the puns, it falls nearly as flat as the literal translation does.  It gets the message across, but it has no weight to it; you're certainly not going to see it passed from person to person.  A poem with a literal translation just isn't going to be sufficiently 'alive' to capture the humor in the original.  The *actual* translation, in 2021, would be a different form of art altogether:

And a year, that meme will be dead too.


## Part V: Golden with Wastage of Gold

> *Old King Cole*  
> *Was a merry old soul*  
> *And a merry old soul was he*  
> *He called for his pipe*  
> *and he called for his bowl*  
> *and he called for his fiddlers three.*  

It's not always true that art forms always progress from simple to complex; [TVTropes has certainly collected enough examples](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnbuiltTrope) to prove that the earliest take on a motif or story can be complex and nuanced in its own right.  But it is true that the first artist to use a trope has no previous examples of it to build on, and the second artist does.  The second artist, in fact, *must* build on it, or alter it, or start somewhat differently, because unless you're Pierre Menhard writing [*Don Quioxte*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Menard,_Author_of_the_Quixote) you can't write an story identical to one that's already well-known and be received as anything but a plagiarist.  And the more times a trope is used, the further from the baseline idea an artist needs to go to be counted as 'original', if originality is the goal.

> *Of an old King in a story*  
> *From the grey sea-folk I have heard*  
> *Whose heart was no more broken*  
> *Than the wings of a bird.*  
>
> *As soon as the moon was silver*  
> *And the thin stars began,*  
> *He took his pipe and his tankard,*  
> *Like an old peasant man.*  
> 
> *And three tall shadows were with him*  
> *And came at his command;*  
> *And played before him for ever*  
> *The fiddles of fairyland.*  
> 
> *And he died in the young summer*  
> *Of the world's desire;*  
> *Before our hearts were broken*  
> *Like sticks in a fire.*  

The same is true for audiences.  When [Superman lifted a car over his head in 1938](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/5a/Action_Comics_1.jpg), that was enough to launch a series of comics that put an entire genre of stories into the public consciousness for decades.  When [Scarlet Witch threw a car with telekinesis in 2016](https://youtu.be/s0BFHg5lYHQ?t=77), it's just one part of a much more elaborate fight scene, hardly worth singling out for mention unless doing a play-by-play.  A man lifting a car can still be an exciting moment in the context of a good story, but there has to *be* a good story around it.  Almost no superhero afficianado would pick up a new comic solely on the basis of "So get this - there's this guy, who can PICK UP A CAR!".  So, authors seeking to make a mark have to branch out further.

And having prior work isn't only a restriction on creativity, either; it can just as easily enable work that couldn't have been written otherwise.  An audience in 2000 wouldn't be impressed by a superhero whose only distinguishing feature was being strong enough to lift cars, but an audience in 1938 wouldn't know what to make of M. Night Shyamalan's film *Unbreakable*.  The fact that the film was in color and the crispness of the picture and music would have been quite impressive, but much of the plot and dialogue would have made little sense; M. Night Shyamalan assumed that his audience would have the shared cultural experience of sixty years of comic books and superheroes, and wrote accordingly.  The question of "how would people with superpowers act in a world like ours, instead of a comic book world?" isn't a terribly interesting question to ask if there aren't well-known comic book worlds to compare it with.

> *In the time of old sin without sadness*  
> *And golden with wastage of gold*  
> *Like the gods that grow old in their gladness*  
> *Was the king that was glad, growing old:*  
> *And with sound of loud lyres from his palace*  
> *The voice of his oracles spoke,*  
> *And the lips that were red from his chalice*  
> *Were splendid with smoke.*  

But if new works have to build on the old, then what stops all art from becoming incomprehensibly complex?  Ultimately, it's the same pressures.  Audiences will only be willing or able to read or watch so much prior work; there's a limit to how much knowledge can be assumed for any audience, and so eventually any author trying to use allusions and metaphors and references as a foundation for his work must either cut off much of his potential audience, or explain the background using time that could be used to further the plot.  A "Previously On" segment in a TV show, even if it's Dragonball Z, can't reasonably take up the entire episode, and certainly can't take up more than that.

For some authors, complexity is the entire point.  Scott Alexander's [*Unsong*](http://unsongbook.com) is a book in a fictional setting in which obscure and unlikely coincidences and references are fundamental to the laws of physics, and which by necessity is filled with jokes that span a dozen dead languages, and as much obscure etymology and history as it does plot or dialogue.  This was the entire point; the author in response to a question said that it was written in part ["as the beginning of a rabbit hole that can be followed arbitrarily far, without a predetermined end, until eventually it even goes out of the text itself"](https://slatestarscratchpad.tumblr.com/post/139818927946/shlevy-im-enjoying-unsong-quite-a-bit-but-i).  Anybody who wanted to go a step further in that direction, and build off that work, would have to be even more well-read and even more persuasive and engaging, or else lose just about all of the potential audience in a maze of metaphor.

> *Cole, that unwearied prince of Colchester,*  
> *Growing more gay with age and with long days*  
> *Deeper in laughter and desire of life*  
> *As that Virginian climber on our walls*  
> *Flames scarlet with the fading of the year;*  
> *Called for his wassail and that other weed*  
> *Virginian also, from the western woods*  
> *Where English Raleigh checked the boast of Spain,*  
> *And lighting joy with joy, and piling up*  
> *Pleasure as crown for pleasure, bade me bring*  
> *Those three, the minstrels whose emblazoned coats*  
> *Shone with the oyster-shells of Colchester;*  
> *And these three played, and playing grew more fain*  
> *Of mirth and music; till the heathen came*  
> *And the King slept beside the northern sea.*  

[Patrick Hannahan's *Gigamesh*](https://books.google.com/books?id=jMvpf5K1qD0C&pg=PA28&lpg=PA28#v=onepage&q&f=false) takes that last step further, being a response to and one-upping of James Joyce's *Ulysses* with its detail and layered references.  There are more than ninety-seven different meanings to the fact that the title does not contain the letter 'L', the length of each of the thousand words in Chapter I form the first thousand digits of π, the letters of each word in Chapter II forms a musical composition for a song based on three different tellings of the Faust legend, the pattern of commas in Chapter VI forms the map of Rome, and these references and riddles and codes pile on and on during each successive chapter until ultimately, *Gigamesh* is so dense that it can't possibly exist.  And it doesn't.

Genres or mediums can go on getting more intricate and involved for a while, so long as existing audiences find it worthwhile to stay and new audiences find it worthwhile to learn and catch up, but not forever.  There's always a limit to how much an audience can get from a work of art, and how much meaning an author can express.  Similarly, there's always a limit on the use of tropes: too esoteric, or too meta, or too otherwise detached from the original patterns, and audiences can no longer understand how the new work connects to the old.   And the closer to those limits an author or a genre gets, the harder it is to appeal to a fresh audience, and the less comprehensible it will be to the uninitiated reader.

> *Kicks stuffing out of Pussyfoot, bids his trio*

> *Catch hold o' the notion, bellow and blurt back "Cole"?*  
> *Must I bawl lessons from a horn-book, howl,*

Whether or not this is a good thing is hard to say.

## Part VI:

So eventually, any artistic genre reaches something of a steady state.  It's still possible in this steady state to make something new and original, but it becomes harder and harder, and artists or authors who want to do something new have to either work increasingly hard to do it, or find a new genre to work in, and the creators who remain tend to fill their niche with a tried-and-true formula.  Formulaic work can keep a genre going for a very long time, but it becomes a delicate balance of getting enough readers or viewers to whom the formula is new to replace the readers and viewers who have moved on.  If that balance gets disrupted -- if the new readers don't see the appeal, or current readers start moving on faster, or the people writing the formula try to alter it for the worse -- then the whole genre can collapse, and other genres or mediums can take its place.

In which case,

## Part VII: 

The most well-known English translation of [Goethe's German play *Faust*](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/14591) was translated by Bayard Taylor in the 1850s, who spent most of his preface talking about why he translated the play into verse and not into prose, like most of the seventeen existing translations of his day had done.  The core of his reasoning was that "Poetry is not simply a fashion of expression: it is the form of expression absolutely required by a certain class of ideas."  According to Taylor, it is impossible to understand the concepts and emotions Goethe was trying to get across merely by reading a literal prosaic translation, no matter how accurate.  And Charles O. Hartman, in his 2015 *Verse: An Introduction to Prosody* says that this is exactly what distinguishes verse from prose:

> Considered from one odd angle, a poem is a miracle of bandwidth . The poet imagines a whole speaking, gesticulating person, complete with a tone of voice and a situation, and compresses that living being into a stream of data only a few bits wide: a few dozen letters and punctuation marks. This stream (after traveling for a day or for hundreds of years, a mile or thousands of miles) reaches a reader who, perhaps without being aware of the process, from this impoverished text imaginatively reconstitutes the voice and the speaker, as alive again as at creation. What we call poetic techniques are methods of supporting this marvel of recovery.
