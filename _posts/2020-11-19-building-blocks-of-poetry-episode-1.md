<div style="display:none;">A ten-minute video about the first building blocks of English poetry: the difference between stressed and unstressed syllables.  Since this took 900 lines of python to make, more videos are unlikely.</div>

# The Building Blocks of Poetry, Episode 1

This is a project I've been working on for a while, in part to make a video talking about the mechanics of poetry writing, but largely to get accustomed to video creation and editing.  I don't have immediate plans for future episodes at the moment.

The animation was done with [manim](https://github.com/3b1b/manim), by Grant Sanderson of the YouTube channel [3Blue1Brown](https://www.3blue1brown.com/about).
