<div style="display:none;">A collection of Mathematica programs and rhymed poetry written for Advent of Code 2022.                                                                                                                </div>

## Mathematica

[This repository](https://github.com/HiggstonRainbird/AoC-2022) stores my [Advent Of Code](http://adventofcode.com/2021) solutions for 2021, written in Mathematica.  I'm back to using .m; I've realized that no Mathematica format is easy to read in text file form, so the .m will most likely not run natively. The code should be somewhat readable as plaintext, but casual Mathematica in general is notebook-heavy, so it's not perfect.  

Though there's no specific subreddit challenge this year, I also wrote a poem for each day's problem, as shown below.  I tried not to repeat the same rhyme and metre scheme too much (and avoided iambic pentameter sonnets, since I used them as a crutch last year and the year before), but ultimately had to repeat a few by the end.

## Poems

### [Day 1](https://www.adventofcode.com/2022/day/1): Where's The Wild Things' Star?

We're now setting up camp  
In the dew and the damp,  
On the hunt for the star-spangled berry,  

And the jungle is thick,  
But we have every trick  
That will make the dark forest less scary,  

So we'll head to the grove  
With its heavenly trove  
(It's a Dijkstra-type maze, so be wary)  

Then the stars will appear,  
And when fifty are here,  
We will eat and we'll drink and be merry.  

### [Day 2](https://www.adventofcode.com/2022/day/2): To Be A Rock And Not To Roll

The match is set.  
The games decide  
Who's near the snacks,  
Who's near the tide.

The Rock is hard,  
But Paper's wide,  
And Scissor's good  
At Paper-cide.  

He gave a sheet  
(Which you have eyed)  
With every throw -  
You'll have to hide.  

You didn't know,  
But had your pride,  
And so you guessed  
The second side.  

When he returned,  
(His name is Clyde)  
He set you right  
(If he's allied).  

It's X to lose  
(Unless he lied),    
And Z to win,  
Or else, you've tied.  

You know the score.  
You have the guide.  
You'll win or lose  
(Unless you've Y'd).  

### [Day 3](https://www.adventofcode.com/2022/day/3): John '5space' Henry

When ol' John Henry was a babe,  
A-sitting on his papa's knee,  
He hammer-swung a tiny fist  
And hammer-hit a keyboard's key.  

They say that mighty Hercules,  
He wrestled pythons in his crib.  
John Henry, too, a Python slew;  
That's what they say, and they don't fib.  

When ol' John Henry was a boy,  
No more than eight (or maybe nine),  
His papa sat him down to code,  
And little John, he learned it fine.  

He typed so fast the frames would fail  
As terminal commands flew by.  
He typed so quick the keys would stick.  
That's what they say, and they don't lie.  

When ol' John Henry was a teen,  
His papa said the day'd arrived.  
"They call me `4space`", said his pop.  
"From here on out, they'll call you `5`."  

But smoke was rising from the hills,  
And filled with gray what once was blue:   
The code machine, it changed the scene.  
That's what they say, and they say true.  

When ol' John Henry was a man,  
And AoC was his domain,  
The code machine rolled up to fight  
And challenged him to end his reign.  

Part 1 it grabbed, ten seconds flat,  
Before John Henry knew what hit him,  
But on Part 2, it ground a gear,  
And Henry moved like crocs had bit him,  
'Cuz he was good and riled now,  
And wouldn't let some AI git him,  
With seven seconds left to go,  
He grabbed the star he knew would fit him.  

But Henry's heart had beat its last  
When he had beat his metal foe.  
They buried John, he's dead and gone.  
That's what they say, and they would know.  

### [Day 4](https://www.adventofcode.com/2022/day/4): A Series of Challenges  
----

*I had writer's block that morning, so I asked [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) to fill in for me and write that day's poem.*

Solving an Advent of Code problem  
Is like a treasure hunt or a quest,  
A series of challenges to overcome  
And a chance to put my skills to the test.  

I start by reading the problem statement  
And breaking it down into bits,  
Thinking about how to approach it  
And coming up with a plan that fits.  

Then I write some code to solve it  
Testing and debugging as I go,  
Making sure it's efficient and correct  
And ready for the next challenge, oh no.  

In the end, I submit my solution  
Feeling proud and accomplished too,  
Another Advent of Code problem solved  
And one step closer to being through.  

*I'm a bit impressed that it can write poetry at all...but I thought there was still some room for improvement.*  

As my character hunts through the jungle  
On a quest for a grove with a star,  
I myself, though I err and I bungle,  
Hunt for challenge, and that's what these are.  

For each problem, I start by not reading:  
Take a glance, make a guess at the rest.  
There's no time to slow down while I'm speeding  
And attempting to code with the best.  

Then I write down some code and submit it,  
Inefficient?  Ha!  *Sluggish*, I'll say.  
And the untested code, I admit it    
Sometimes works the first try, like today.  

In the end, I've had fun and competed,  
Having raced through the thing like a master,  
And with two shiny stars now completed,  
I can't help but think I could be faster.

### [Day 5](https://www.adventofcode.com/2022/day/5): Safety First (In Last Out)

A couple years ago, when it was winter,  
And Cratemover Two Thousand was the latest,  
When somebody was [busy with the printer](https://adventofcode.com/2017/day/1)  
And someone else took [*Breakout!*](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/13) for a playtest,  
The wooden crates we had (and feared would splinter),  
Held presents, and the top crate was the greatest.  
Inside - what child wouldn't love to smack it? -  
Was bubble wrap with bubble wrap to pack it.  

If salt goes bad, with what can it be seasoned?  
If bug reports don't work, how would you know it?  
The wrap was safe on top (or so we reasoned),  
And surely safer than the stuff below it.  
I said "We wouldn't want the crate to squeeze" and  
"It's earned the place of honor" said the poet,  
And so our finest gift, our precious jewel  
Sat high atop the stack, as if to rule.  

The tallest stack, of course, sticks out the tallest,  
And that became a problem when a blizzard -  
The worst we had in years, in fact, the squall-est -  
Blew forth as if cast at us by a wizard.  
(The wizard's just one guess, though it's a small list;  
"Don't irk him, just in case" still sometimes is heard).  
We thought our stack of crates was doing well,  
Until at last, on Christmas Eve, it fell.  

Alas!  The bubble wrap had all been frozen  
Before it fell from such a risky height.  
The wind on top was strong; if we had chosen  
Some slightly smaller stacks, it'd be all right.  
It burst and shattered like it had a hose in;  
No children got to play with it that night.  
We're careful, now, when getting cargo loaded.  
We still remember what the ice and snow did.

### [Day 7](https://www.adventofcode.com/2022/day/7): Day Seven's Sonnet

Initialize the stack, and add the root  
(The root's the forward slash, just so you know).  
The `cd x` commands aren't absolute,  
So `cd x` goes up; `..`, below.  

And now you should initialize a hash  
(Not memory-efficient, but it's fine).  
You'll travel all the way back up to `/`  
Each time you see a number start a line.  

For every subdirectory you see,  
You'll add-assign the file size, and then  
You'll look for the next file (or `cd`)  
And when you find one, do it all again.  

You'll filter out by size to solve part 1,  
And part 2 works the same.  And now, you're done.  

### [Day 8](https://www.adventofcode.com/2022/day/8): [I Wonder Where the Flowers Is](https://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/brooklyn_national_anthem_spring_is_sprung)

It's visible, the trees is,  
From way outside the grid,  
Unless the outside breezes  
(At ten times nine degrees-es)   
Hit taller trees than these is.  
If so, the trees is hid.  

A local's expertise is  
What gives the scenic score.  
She counts up what she sees-es:  
The short trees and their leaves-es.  
(The tall ones, hid by eaves-es).  
She multiplies the four.

You might want our committee  
To not do what Therese says.  
The north side sees the city!  
The south side sees the seas-es!  
You might think it's a pity  
To follow these caprices,  
But I'll give you the keys-es  
To visit when you pleases,  
And though it's itty-bitty  
I'm certain you'll agrees-es:  
It's really rather pretty,  
This house atop the trees-es.
