<div style="display:none;">A collection of Mathematica programs and rhymed poetry written for Advent of Code 2022.                                                                                                                </div>

## Mathematica

[This repository](https://github.com/HiggstonRainbird/AoC-2022) stores my [Advent Of Code](http://adventofcode.com/2021) solutions for 2021, written in Mathematica.  I'm back to using .m; I've realized that no Mathematica format is easy to read in text file form, so the .m will most likely not run natively. The code should be somewhat readable as plaintext, but casual Mathematica in general is notebook-heavy, so it's not perfect.  

Though there's no specific subreddit challenge this year, I also wrote a poem for each day's problem, as shown below.  I tried not to repeat the same rhyme and metre scheme too much (and avoided iambic pentameter sonnets, since I used them as a crutch last year and the year before), but ultimately had to repeat a few by the end.

## Days Completed

## Poems

### [Day 1](https://www.adventofcode.com/2022/day/1): Where's The Wild Things' Star?

We're now setting up camp  
In the dew and the damp,  
On the hunt for the star-spangled berry,  

And the jungle is thick,  
But we have every trick  
That will make the dark forest less scary,  

So we'll head to the grove  
With its heavenly trove  
(It's a Dijkstra-type maze, so be wary)  

Then the stars will appear,  
And when fifty are here,  
We will eat and we'll drink and be merry.  

### [Day 2](https://www.adventofcode.com/2021/day/2): To Be A Rock And Not To Roll**

The match is set.  
The games decide  
Who's near the snacks,  
Who's near the tide.

The Rock is hard,  
But Paper's wide,  
And Scissor's good  
At Paper-cide.  

He gave a sheet  
(Which you have eyed)  
With every throw -  
You'll have to hide.  

You didn't know,  
But had your pride,  
And so you guessed  
The second side.  

When he returned,  
(His name is Clyde)  
He set you right  
(If he's allied).  

It's X to lose  
(Unless he lied),    
And Z to win,  
Or else, you've tied.  

You know the score.  
You have the guide.  
You'll win or lose  
(Unless you've Y'd).
