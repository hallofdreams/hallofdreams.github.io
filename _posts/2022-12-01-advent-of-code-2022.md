<div style="display:none;">A collection of Mathematica programs and rhymed poetry written for Advent of Code 2022.  Highlights include the ballad of John Henry, an OSHA-approved fable, and a grammatically precarious treehouse.</div>

## Mathematica

[This repository](https://github.com/HiggstonRainbird/AoC-2022) stores my [Advent Of Code](http://adventofcode.com/2022) solutions for 2022, written in Mathematica.  I'm back to using .m; I've realized that no Mathematica format is easy to read in text file form, so the .m will most likely not run natively. The code should be somewhat readable as plaintext, but casual Mathematica in general is notebook-heavy, so it's not perfect.  

Though there's no specific subreddit challenge this year, I also wrote a poem for each day's problem, as shown below.  It got progressively more difficult as time went on.

## Poems

### [Day 1](https://www.adventofcode.com/2022/day/1): Where's The Wild Things' Star?

We're now setting up camp  
In the dew and the damp,  
On the hunt for the star-spangled berry,  

And the jungle is thick,  
But we have every trick  
That will make the dark forest less scary,  

So we'll head to the grove  
With its heavenly trove  
(It's a Dijkstra-type maze, so be wary)  

Then the stars will appear,  
And when fifty are here,  
We will eat and we'll drink and be merry.  

### [Day 2](https://www.adventofcode.com/2022/day/2): To Be A Rock And Not To Roll

The match is set.  
The games decide  
Who's near the snacks,  
Who's near the tide.

The Rock is hard,  
But Paper's wide,  
And Scissor's good  
At Paper-cide.  

He gave a sheet  
(Which you have eyed)  
With every throw -  
You'll have to hide.  

You didn't know,  
But had your pride,  
And so you guessed  
The second side.  

When he returned,  
(His name is Clyde)  
He set you right  
(If he's allied).  

It's X to lose  
(Unless he lied),    
And Z to win,  
Or else, you've tied.  

You know the score.  
You have the guide.  
You'll win or lose  
(Unless you've Y'd).  

### [Day 3](https://www.adventofcode.com/2022/day/3): John '5space' Henry

When ol' John Henry was a babe,  
A-sitting on his papa's knee,  
He hammer-swung a tiny fist  
And hammer-hit a keyboard's key.  

They say that mighty Hercules,  
He wrestled pythons in his crib.  
John Henry, too, a Python slew;  
That's what they say, and they don't fib.  

When ol' John Henry was a boy,  
No more than eight (or maybe nine),  
His papa sat him down to code,  
And little John, he learned it fine.  

He typed so fast the frames would fail  
As terminal commands flew by.  
He typed so quick the keys would stick.  
That's what they say, and they don't lie.  

When ol' John Henry was a teen,  
His papa said the day'd arrived.  
"They call me `4space`", said his pop.  
"From here on out, they'll call you `5`."  

But smoke was rising from the hills,  
And filled with gray what once was blue:   
The code machine, it changed the scene.  
That's what they say, and they say true.  

When ol' John Henry was a man,  
And AoC was his domain,  
The code machine rolled up to fight  
And challenged him to end his reign.  

Part 1 it grabbed, ten seconds flat,  
Before John Henry knew what hit him,  
But on Part 2, it ground a gear,  
And Henry moved like crocs had bit him,  
'Cuz he was good and riled now,  
And wouldn't let some AI git him,  
With seven seconds left to go,  
He grabbed the star he knew would fit him.  

But Henry's heart had beat its last  
When he had beat his metal foe.  
They buried John, he's dead and gone.  
That's what they say, and they would know.  

### [Day 4](https://www.adventofcode.com/2022/day/4): A Series of Challenges  
----

*I had writer's block that morning, so I asked [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) to fill in for me and write that day's poem.*

Solving an Advent of Code problem  
Is like a treasure hunt or a quest,  
A series of challenges to overcome  
And a chance to put my skills to the test.  

I start by reading the problem statement  
And breaking it down into bits,  
Thinking about how to approach it  
And coming up with a plan that fits.  

Then I write some code to solve it  
Testing and debugging as I go,  
Making sure it's efficient and correct  
And ready for the next challenge, oh no.  

In the end, I submit my solution  
Feeling proud and accomplished too,  
Another Advent of Code problem solved  
And one step closer to being through.  

*I'm a bit impressed that it can write poetry at all...but I thought there was still some room for improvement.*  

As my character hunts through the jungle  
On a quest for a grove with a star,  
I myself, though I err and I bungle,  
Hunt for challenge, and that's what these are.  

For each problem, I start by not reading:  
Take a glance, make a guess at the rest.  
There's no time to slow down while I'm speeding  
And attempting to code with the best.  

Then I write down some code and submit it,  
Inefficient?  Ha!  *Sluggish*, I'll say.  
And the untested code, I admit it    
Sometimes works the first try, like today.  

In the end, I've had fun and competed,  
Having raced through the thing like a master,  
And with two shiny stars now completed,  
I can't help but think I could be faster.

### [Day 5](https://www.adventofcode.com/2022/day/5): Safety First (In Last Out)

A couple years ago, when it was winter,  
And Cratemover Two Thousand was the latest,  
When somebody was [busy with the printer](https://adventofcode.com/2017/day/1)  
And someone else took [*Breakout!*](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/13) for a playtest,  
The wooden crates we had (and feared would splinter),  
Held presents, and the top crate was the greatest.  
Inside - what child wouldn't love to smack it? -  
Was bubble wrap with bubble wrap to pack it.  

If salt goes bad, with what can it be seasoned?  
If bug reports don't work, how would you know it?  
The wrap was safe on top (or so we reasoned),  
And surely safer than the stuff below it.  
I said "We wouldn't want the crate to squeeze" and  
"It's earned the place of honor" said the poet,  
And so our finest gift, our precious jewel  
Sat high atop the stack, as if to rule.  

The tallest stack, of course, sticks out the tallest,  
And that became a problem when a blizzard -  
The worst we had in years, in fact, the squall-est -  
Blew forth as if cast at us by a wizard.  
(The wizard's just one guess, though it's a small list;  
"Don't irk him, just in case" still sometimes is heard).  
We thought our stack of crates was doing well,  
Until at last, on Christmas Eve, it fell.  

Alas!  The bubble wrap had all been frozen  
Before it fell from such a risky height.  
The wind on top was strong; if we had chosen  
Some slightly smaller stacks, it'd be all right.  
It burst and shattered like it had a hose in;  
No children got to play with it that night.  
We're careful, now, when getting cargo loaded.  
We still remember what the ice and snow did.

### [Day 7](https://www.adventofcode.com/2022/day/7): Day Seven's Sonnet

Initialize the stack, and add the root  
(The root's the forward slash, just so you know).  
The `cd x` commands aren't absolute,  
So `cd x` goes up; `..`, below.  

And now you should initialize a hash  
(Not memory-efficient, but it's fine).  
You'll travel all the way back up to `/`  
Each time you see a number start a line.  

For every subdirectory you see,  
You'll add-assign the file size, and then  
You'll look for the next file (or `cd`)  
And when you find one, do it all again.  

You'll filter out by size to solve part 1,  
And part 2 works the same.  And now, you're done.  

### [Day 8](https://www.adventofcode.com/2022/day/8): [I Wonder Where the Flowers Is](https://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/brooklyn_national_anthem_spring_is_sprung)

It's visible, the trees is,  
From way outside the grid,  
Unless the outside breezes  
(At ten times nine degrees-es)   
Hit taller trees than these is.  
If so, the trees is hid.  

A local's expertise is  
What gives the scenic score.  
She counts up what she sees-es:  
The short trees and their leaves-es.  
(The tall ones, hid by eaves-es).  
She multiplies the four.

You might want our committee  
To not do what Therese says.  
The north side sees the city!  
The south side sees the seas-es!  
You might think it's a pity  
To follow these caprices,  
But I'll give you the keys-es  
To visit when you pleases,  
And though it's itty-bitty  
I'm certain you'll agrees-es:  
It's really rather pretty,  
This house atop the trees-es.

### [Day 9](https://www.adventofcode.com/2022/day/9): Lazy Limerick #1

There's a treacherous bridge, and a strait  
But your rope physics models can't wait.  
As the bridge breaks apart  
Hope your model is smart;  
Better hurry, or you will be late.  

### [Day 10](https://www.adventofcode.com/2022/day/10): [One Shade The More, One Ray The Less](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43844/she-walks-in-beauty)

The CPU counts down the second  
To draw its pixels like a pen.  
Just fix the thing, and at your beck and  
Call the Elves will be again.  

(Then again, *you've* done the work here  
Getting gadgets up to spec.  
Perhaps you'll rest a moment, lurk here  
Before you're at their call, and beck).  

There is a forty cycle bookend  
Drawing pixels left to right.  
You'll know, if you check each nook and  
Cranny, where to put the sprite.  

(But man, [you've timed](https://adventofcode.com/2016/day/15) [a lot](https://adventofcode.com/2016/day/25) [of circuits](https://adventofcode.com/2017/day/1),  
And [given opcodes](https://adventofcode.com/2017/day/23) [lots](https://adventofcode.com/2016/day/12) [of looks](https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/19).  
Perhaps you'll rest; it's always work, it's  
Searching crannies and their nooks.)  

You've found a dry spot in this cove (or  
Dry enough to fix the fall) -  
"I'm on my way", you tell them, "Over  
And out", you say, and end the call.  

(You didn't give an ETA, no  
Promise for when you'd be back,  
And that's just fine; for all that they know  
It takes weeks.  You have some slack.  
And sure, it might take just a day, no  
Doubt you're skilled now as a rover,  
But sometimes rest is *mucho bueno*,  
Before you climb on out, and over.)  

### [Day 11](https://www.adventofcode.com/2022/day/11): Simian Shenanigans
*To the tune of the middle part of Weird Al's "[Hardware Store](https://youtu.be/DFI6cV9slfI?t=130)".*

Sigh.  
Would you look at all that stuff...  
They got:  

Sets of sandals, super-soakers,  
Stainless stacking sausage smokers,  
Stocking stuffers, sparking snuffers,  
Swimsuits and some snacks by Stouffers,

[Saturn Stoichiometrators](https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/14)!  

Man, that's a heavy pack!  You should have told me!  
No wonder that poor rope bridge couldn't hold me.  

### [Day 12](https://www.adventofcode.com/2022/day/12): [Excelsior!](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44631/excelsior-56d223cb4e6fa)

The shades of night were falling fast  
As through a lettered heightmap passed  
A programmer, who for advice  
Looked often at his strange device:  
Excelsior!  

He could not climb, but drops, he likes.  
Not monotonic were his hikes  
No straight path did he follow down  
But often checked, without a frown,  
Excelsior!  

He spiraled up the mountain's height  
And at the top, beheld a sight  
Of coders who had never stirred  
And who had never seen the word  
Excelsior!  

"Pray tell," said one to him who climbed  
"For us, the BFS was primed.  
We did not have to climb at all,  
So how'd you make it?  What's that called?"  
"Excelsior!"  

The answer came both quick and blunt.  
"It's just an advertising stunt!  
I'm representing Office Pro  
Who wanted everyone to know  
[Excelsior](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/zkehl4/2022_day_12_time_for_some_excel_just_because_we/)!"  

### [Day 13](https://www.adventofcode.com/2022/day/13): Distress Signal

There's trouble here!  It's gone awry!  
We're out of cookies, cream, and pie!  
The ice cream truck, it passed us by!  
So do you copy?  Please reply!  

My hiking jacket ripped and tore  
(And also, there's a dinosaur  
That's smashing trees with quite the roar).  
We left the foosball on the shore!  

The eggnog's low - I think it's theft  
(It's huge, three tons at least, its heft)  
There's only fifteen barrels left,  
When they run dry, we'll be bereft!  

Our campsite is an awful mess -  
We lost the cleaning plans, I guess.  
(The monster looks like it's from Ness)  
So hear our signal of distress!  

### [Day 14](https://www.adventofcode.com/2022/day/14): The Castle

I took a bucket with me, and a trowel,  
Some sunscreen, an umbrella, not much more.  
I wore some swim trunks, had with me a towel,  
The day I made a sculpture on the shore.  

It took a bit of time; I didn't stop  
As waves crashed in and slunk back to the sea.  
I bucket-tipped, on tiptoes, overtop,  
Until the towers towered over me.  

A lofty goal a lot of work requires:  
I piled sand as tall as I could reach,  
And then I carved, made moats and keeps and spires,  
Until, at last, 'twas time to leave the beach.  

I ruled the tides and overlooked the land,  
The day I built a castle out of sand.  

### [Day 15](https://www.adventofcode.com/2022/day/15): Calculatus Eliminatus

It isn't underneath the sink,  
It isn't on the tables;  
I looked under the couch, I think,  
And even checked the cables.  

The basement, past those cobwebs?  No
(Although I might have missed it).  
I couldn't move the washer, though;  
Perhaps you could assist it.  

The attic?  Eh - I saw a rat  
Last time I looked between.  
The attic is the one place that  
We never have to clean.  

Besides, there's no way it's in *there*  
If nobody's been in it,  
But two people could move these shelves  
If you could spare a minute.

I peeled up all the rugs just now,  
And looked through all the keys.
We've checked a lot of places - how  
Has it not been in these?  

In puzzlement, I scratch my head:  
Where have my glasses got?  
But I can't find them, so instead,  
I'll find out where they're not.
