  <h2>Welcome to the Spire</h2>
  <p>This is a custom page for our Spire RPG campaign. The layout and styling are completely independent from the rest of the site.</p>

  <p>You can add any content here - character sheets, campaign notes, session logs, etc. The page uses its own CSS and HTML structure with a distinctive RPG rulebook aesthetic.</p>

  <h2>Campaign Overview</h2>
  <p>The Spire is a mile-high city of nightmare and wonder, where the high elves rule with an iron fist and the dark elves toil in bondage. You are members of the Ministry, a secret organization dedicated to overthrowing the high elf government through espionage, sabotage, and revolution.</p>

  <div class="spire-sidebar">
    <h3>Key Locations</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>The Works</strong> - Industrial district</li>
      <li><strong>Derelictus</strong> - The abandoned district</li>
      <li><strong>Red Row</strong> - Entertainment district</li>
      <li><strong>Amaranth</strong> - High elf gardens</li>
      <li><strong>The Vermissian</strong> - Ancient train network</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <p>The city is divided into districts, each with its own character and dangers. As members of the Ministry, you operate in the shadows, building your network, gathering resources, and striking at the heart of high elf power.</p>

  <h2>Session Notes</h2>

  <h3>Session 1: The Beginning</h3>
  <p>Notes about your first session go here. Your characters met in the depths of the Spire, each with their own reasons for joining the Ministry. The high elves' oppression had taken its toll, and revolution was the only path forward.</p>

  <h3>Session 2: The Heist</h3>
  <p>The second session saw your team infiltrating a high elf administrative building in Amaranth. Stealth and cunning were required to acquire the documents that would expose corruption at the highest levels of government.</p>
