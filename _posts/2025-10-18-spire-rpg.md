  <h2>Overview</h2>

  <p>The Supreme Adjudicator of the Conservatory is dead, killed in what officials are calling a burglary gone wrong. The Ministry sees  an opportunity. With the succession wide open and seven factions controlling votes for the next Supreme Adjudicator, a brief window exists to secure permanent influence over one of the Spire's most powerful institutions. A council of elders within the Ministry has authorized an operation: infiltrate the Mezzanine, identify which candidate can be controlled, and ensure they win the election. Success means the Ministry gains access to cutting-edge research, and leverage over the academic power structure. Failure means losing the district to forces hostile to the resistance.</p>

  <p>You are one of the ministers chosen for this mission. You have been enrolled in the Conservatory, given a dossier on the candidates and major power players, and some grungy quarters to call your own. That’s it.</p> 

  <p>Your mission: secure a Supreme Adjudicator the Ministry can control. How you accomplish that is up to you.</p>

   <div class="spire-sidebar">
    <h3>About this game</h3>
    <p>This is a long document, it has props (32 of them!), it has appendices, it adds a whole new section to The Spire. None of this is official, all of this is for you, the reader, to use. Take any npcs, any plot ideas, any scenes or even just general ideas. Plifer freely, skim, steal, enjoy.</p>
  </div>

  <h2 id="the-mezzanine">The Mezzanine</h2>

  <p>Nestled on one edge of the Spire, occasionally smothered in the smog of The Works above it and looking down on Pilgrim's Row, is The Mezzanine: an isolated, perfect enclave of academic wisdom. A shining tower of knowledge, separate from worldly desires. Or so they'd like to pretend, anyway.</p>

  <p>The Mezzanine is home to the mysterious Brazzacot Institute and a constellation of prestigious academic institutions collectively known as "The Conservatory." Marble buildings compete with brutalist architecture, ancient libraries squat beside gleaming laboratories, and everywhere the sound of heated debate mingles with the clash of chariotball matches. Wealthy Aelfir students in elaborate masks brush past exhausted Drow working side jobs between lectures. Professors scheme over grant money while students organize protests that will be crushed within hours. Money flows freely from patrons, cults, and criminal enterprises, all eager to fund the cutting-edge research happening here: from applied demonology to consciousness studies and galvanic experimentation.</p>
  
  <p>For drow students, the reality is bleak. For the few drow wealthy enough to trade servitude for tuition, the Mezzanine is a gilded cage where they simply exchange one master for another. But for the far greater number on scholarships or borrowed coin, the district is a meat grinder. These students live in constant precarity, taking on dangerous work, running errands for criminals, or selling themselves to patrons for a chance to stay afloat. Most don't make it. They burn out, fall into debt, and are quietly swept away, replaced by a fresh wave of hopefuls, their failure serving as just another footnote in the Conservatory's long and unforgiving history.
  </p>

<br>

  <h2 id="whats-really-going-on">What's really going on</h2>

  <p>Monamon Leaves-Fall-In-Agony needed the Supreme Adjudicator dead. He was the obvious successor, and with his newfound Elidon granting him supernatural luck, the timing was perfect. He assembled a team of competent professionals, criminals and hired muscle with no direct ties to him or the University. Disposable assets. </p>
  <p>From the beginning he seeded dissent. Promises of larger payouts if fewer returned, quiet suggestions to the paranoid that one of their number might be an informant, carefully planted suspicions. Nothing overt, just enough to guarantee betrayal once the job was done.</p>

  <p>The assassination itself went perfectly. The team entered the Supreme Adjudicator's office, killed him efficiently, and against their orders cracked his safe and stole everything inside, including his will. The Elidon's luck ensured the job was clean: guards on break at the right time, witnesses remembering wrong details, minimal evidence left behind. It looked like a professional burglary gone tragically wrong. </p>
  <p>The team regrouped at a prearranged location near a Vermissian entrance to divvy up the take and dispose of evidence. This is where Monamon's plan and the Elidon's influence turned the team against each other. The suspicious one really did look like he was working for someone else. Accusations flew. Someone drew a weapon. The Elidon made every escalation worse than it should have been: an itchy trigger finger going off at the wrong time, rage prevailing over flight. </p>
  <p>By the time Monamon's cleanup crew arrived, most of the team was already dead or dying. The crew finished off the survivors. Only Viper escaped, fleeing into the Vermissian before the cleanup crew could corner her. </p>
  <p>The official investigation declared it a burglary gone wrong. Thieves killed the Supreme Adjudicator, then turned on each other over the loot. Tragic, but these things happen. Curfew will be extended and some innocent drow will be punished to maintain appearances. The case closed with Monamon having to exert almost no influence at all. The will was noted as missing from the safe, presumed stolen by the criminals. No one connected it to Monamon. </p>

   <div class="spire-sidebar">
    <h3> INVESTIGATING THE ASSASSINATION</h3>
    <p>The Assassination is not the focus of this campaign. If players investigate the assassination, they can uncover useful leverage. The crime scene was suspiciously professional for a "burglary," witnesses have inconsistent memories, and the bodies of the team can be traced to various criminal networks. Most importantly: Viper survived and knows Monamon ordered the hit, and evidence exists connecting Monamon to the cleanup crew. Investigating requires significant time and effort that could be spent on the actual mission: manipulating the election. The assassination is closed officially, and most NPCs have moved on. Digging into it marks players as either Ministry agents or troublemakers, drawing unwanted attention. Use the investigation as a side quest if players are stuck or need leverage against Monamon, not as the campaign's focus.
    </p>
  </div>

  <p>Monamon got what he wanted: the Supreme Adjudicator dead, his succession assured, and the crime officially solved. The mess was regrettable but containable. The missing will is annoying but not fatal.</p>

  <p>This of course has kicked off the succession crisis that has the Mezzanine all aflutter. Monamon thinks he has this election on lockdown, and indeed between his Elidon and his control of the electors it feels like a sure thing, but several candidates have emerged, all of them vying for power, and influence. Now that the players are here, it's anyone's game.</p>

<h1 id="the-cast">The Cast</h1>
<div class="spire-section spire-two-column">
  <h2>Using NPCs</h2>

  <p>There are more NPCs here than any sane campaign is expected to use, and being realistic, the players will focus on a few main NPCs, probably a couple candidates and any Big Players who can help them with their goals. This is totally fine, the other NPCs can be background color, and stay there until the players inevitably kill major players and you're forced to bring background NPCs into focus… but generally if an NPC isn't relevant to the campaign the players are interested in exploring, they can be mostly ignored.</p>

  <p>NPCs are also hooks, if things are going too smoothly for the players, (or conversely too terribly), that is the time when a background NPC should interfere in some way that makes things interesting and highlights that while the PCs have been off doing their thing the NPC has been pursuing their agenda as well.</p>

  <p>Use NPCs recklessly. Make them make messy mistakes, costly decisions and devious plots. If they die, there's dozens of other power hungry aspirants ready to take their place, perhaps even worse than their predecessors. Killing a candidate just means the others will be ready for assassins, and will have the added benefit of the sympathy brought by the death of their colleague, creating a power vacuum and bringing previously ignored problems to the forefront. It can also be a great opportunity for some non-candidate big player to make a bid for candidacy or push a candidate hard.  If the players are having trouble focusing, kill off or sideline some NPCs. Anyone other than Monamon can drop out of the race suddenly, or die and provide a great hook that way, or have a major heel turn and try to burn the players, or get them on board. After all if the players are making waves (and when aren't they) someone is bound to try and recruit them.</p>

  <p>Remember, and remind the players, their primary goal is to be able to control and influence a candidate. Other NPCs are useful assets in pursuit of that, but too much effort trying to turn say The Red Baron is likely to result in missing out on opportunities to sway their candidates.</p>

   <div class="spire-sidebar">
    <h3> WHY THE TAROT?</h3>
    <p>Each major NPC is associated with a tarot card from the Major Arcana. Why? Because it's cool, it's thematic and because, you, as the GM can use it as an easy way to remember who is who and what they're doing. Use them however you find helpful. It's fun to lean into the mystical and use the traditional meanings as inspiration when an NPC needs to make a choice, but it's just a tool. Like everything else in this document, feel free to cut it entirely. Some of the NPCs match their cards, while others are darkly ironic interpretations. This is by design.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="spire-sidebar">
    <h3> NPC STATS</h3>
    <p>NPC Stats are in appendix 1, but most NPCs are just… regular aelfir/drow with no real combat skills. If they’re cornered and have to fight, give them 3 resistance and an appropriate weapon (usually 1d3). Someone like Lana might have a trick or three up their sleeve, but realistically, they should be protected by bodyguards, escorted and in situations where they’re not being bludgeoned by angry Ministry agents bent on their death.

  <h3>Monamon Leaves-Fall-In-Agony (The Emperor)
   </h3>

  <p>Monamon Leaves-Fall-In-Agony is a monster. More so than most Aelfir. He’s gotten to the top of the High University of Arcane Magic through a mix of utter ruthlessness, being clever, and an Elidon from his friends at the College of Undying Light that grants him supernatural luck.</p>
  <h4>Why is he important?</h4>
  <p>He’s the primary candidate for the The University of Arcane Magic, and terribly well connected and influential. He’s not going to relinquish power easily. He had the Supreme Adjudicator killed, with the knowledge that he was the likely heir. The hit team went slightly off the rails when the team also burgled the Supreme Adjudicator’s office, much to Monamon’s displeasure.  Monamon pulls a lot of strings in the Mezzanine, and he’s stacked the deck in his favor. His family is also quite wealthy though as a second son, he’s not *disgustingly* rich. His main power is his connections, almost nothing happens in the conservatory without Monamon knowing.   
</p>

  <h4>What sets him apart from the Aelfir?</h4>
  <p>Monanon would be your standard evil conniving Aelfir, if it weren't for his Elidon, tied to the Weaver of Fate, a demon who controls fortune, and who grants Monamon incredible luck and boosts his already impressive charisma. The Weaver makes it so not only that Monamon is almost impossible to assassinate by ordinary means (and his rivals have tried), but also so that his plans come to fruition, even when they’re incredibly unlikely, which is part of what made assassinating the Supreme Adjudicator and remaining undiscovered possible. The Elidon’s powers are not cheap however, Monamon must feed it the intelligence and wit of particularly promising students, via a horrific ritual that renders them almost brain-dead. He’s so far managed to keep the fact that his smartest students always wind up “burning out” and dropping from the program a secret.  
  </p>

  <h4>What does he desire?</h4>
  <p>Monamon is a narcissist and wants power above all. Becoming the Supreme Adjudicator is only the first step. Once he’s in power he plans to become the dean of the University of Arcane Magic as well, and eventually make his pact with The Weaver so powerful that nothing and no one can oust him. In the meantime though, he’ll settle for sating his lust for power with groveling sycophants, displays of his vast power, and crushing those that seek to oppose him. </p>
  
  <p>He also has a vast collection of exotic birds in his office that he cares deeply for, in a twisted kind of way. He doesn’t love *specific birds* but the idea of a living avian ecosystem of superior bird species. One of the duties of his interns is caring for this exotic aviary.</p>

  <h4>What does he despise?</h4>
  <p>As useful as his 'friends' in the college of undying light have been in providing him with the elidon and furnishing him with the knowledge to use it, Monamon greatly resents that he needs them and the various favors he’s had to do to stay in their good graces. He’s working towards disposing of them, of course, but that will take time.</p>

  <p>Monamon is also more extreme than most Aelfir, barely able to conceal his disdain for drow, which he sees, at best, as tools, and more generally as a plague of vermin. He also *despises* Theodore whom he sees as an absolute traitor to everything the Aelfir represent. </p>

  <p>His wife is the bane of his existence. Monamon married her politically and the two loathe each other the way only two people forced to entangle their lives against their will can loathe each other. Their conversations resemble knife fights more than anything else.</p>

  <h4>What can you take from him?</h4>
  <p>Monamon is super well connected, and has a lot of influence in the University of Arcane Magic, especially among the students, where he is very well liked. He has dirt on a large number of powerful and well connected people, notably several well placed people in the Office of Student Affairs, as well as strong connections to the Recreation and Athletics department. His Elidon can be used to make unlikely and difficult plans work, and of course The Weaver will happily patronize whoever is willing to feed it. Monamon is independently wealthy, but not to a degree that’s likely to matter in the scale of the players plans, however he *does* have access to many grants granted to him so he could continue his research into Aelfir Cultural Harmony, and has vast influence over how grants are distributed in general.</p>


<div class="spire-sidebar">
    <h3> DEMONOLOGY IN THE SPIRE</h3>
    <p>For mechanics on summoning, binding, and banishing demons and additional lore, see the Black Magic sourcebook page 14 and the core rulebook page 81. The short of it is that demons and demonology are inherently dangerous, but also rife with potential rewards. Nothing is free, and the reckless use of demonology will get everyone in a large radius killed or worse. The Weaver would be more than happy to make a deal with the players, if they can continually feed it ambitious young people with notable intelligence. Of course the more they use it, the more it will want. This changes the tone of the campaign significantly, but it can be interesting. Alternatively feel free to have rebinding the elidon require an elaborate ritual that only a truly experienced demonologist would know.  If the players run into Monamon’s Elidon luck more than once, don’t be subtle about “something funky and supernatural” is going on here. Players can be surprisingly bad at hints, so if you need to clobber them with “a bird literally flies in the path of the bullet at the last second. HOW UNLIKELY” do that. 
    </p>
  </div>
<h4>Suggested Scenes</h4>

<ol>
<li><strong>One of Monamon's brilliant students, she won the Ice-Falls-Upon-The-Dew Honors Award last month, has become a burnt-out shell.</strong> But it's the way it happened that has people spooked. She was fine, then over three days just hollowed out. Now students are scared to interact with anyone in the Arcane College's Vermissian department. People think it's catching. Two other students have shown early signs, forgetting things, spacing out. Is it exhaustion? Curse? Disease? No one knows, but the rumors are spreading faster than whatever it actually is. At least one version claims it's hungry ghosts, another that Monamon's birds brought it from some human archology.</li>

<li><strong>Monamon is giving a lecture to his entirely Aelfir class somewhere in the Mezzanine.</strong> The players see an attempted assassination fail as the assassin somehow flubs what should have been an easy shot and then tumbles from his hiding spot into the hands of campus security that just happen to be in the area.</li>

<li><strong>Monamon is slated to give a general lecture open to everyone.</strong> When the players show up any non-aelfir are being made to stand, in cramped and uncomfortable quarters out of the sight of the lectern. The two solar paladins managing the crowd are not polite about it. Before the players can leave, a group of student activists arrive. They're all wearing masks, yelling about drow equality, one of them throws an entire bucket of paint at Monamon. Monamon just stands at his lectern and *smiles*, covered in green pain and gestures at them as an example of the "Drow low brow intellect and propensity to violence" he was just talking about. There's yelling, Students are fleeing, the solar paladins are overwhelmed, but not for long.</li>

<li><strong>The players are researching demonology.</strong> Wherever they are, whatever it is they're looking for, Monamon is there first, looking disgruntled, out of place, not even disguised. He's accompanied by an assistant who seems almost delighted to be there. Whatever it is the players are after, the assistant is carrying, along with a pile of related books or objects.</li>

<li><strong>If the players suffer sufficient reputation fallout and are known to be opposing Monamon, he uses his influence in high society to make things hard for them.</strong> As a moderate Reputation Fallout, the player is blacklisted: The doors of high society are closed to them. They get turned away at parties, people won't be seen speaking to them. The reason is clear, Monamon has declared them persona non-grata, and his word carries weight. Unless they can craft a compelling narrative, they won't be going to any parties any time soon.</li>

<h3>Lana Montegue (Judgment)</h3>
<h4>Why is she important?</h4>

<p>Lana comes from Drow nobility, and is actually in the running to win the race and become Supreme Adjudicator, a non-trivial fact, considering the role has been in the hands of an Aelfir family since time immemorial. She's the chosen candidate of the Brazzacot Institute, an organization where she holds massive sway. While she doesn't have the votes yet, the support of the Brazzacot Institute and her massive wealth are letting her mount an effective, if probably doomed, campaign. As a high level member of the Brazzacot Technical Institute, she has a magical crystal embedded in her brain, one that allows her to communicate and share knowledge with other high level members of the organization who are also part of the greater Intelligence.</p>

<p>She also has a terrible secret. She's a Supreme Savant of the Sisterhood of Illumination, a Demonologist Cult. She created the Elidon currently in Monamon's hands, and she's as great a threat to the stability of the Spire as Monamon.</p>

<h4>What sets her apart?</h4>
<p>Lana is fiendishly intelligent, and embarked in a plan that will see her seize control of a not insignificant part of the Spire. The plan has been years in the making, and is now perilously close to failing due to the incompetence of others. Lana created the Weaver's Web, an Elidon capable of twisting fate, one that feeds on raw minds, all while cultivating a relationship with the Brazzacot Technical Institute, home to a technology that unifies hundreds of minds. The plan was to use the Intelligence Crystal in a ritual to juice up the Weaver's Web to its full potential… and then before she had the chance to activate it, her lackeys in Sisterhood managed to get it stolen right from under their noses. Which meant Lana had to go ahead with getting the crystal implanted in her skull, instead of feeding it right to the Weaver.</p>

<p>This doesn't mean Lana has given up. To keep the institute from learning the extent of her plans, she compartmentalized part of her memories, a feat that takes a tremendous mental toll on her. She has a ritual to suppress the Weaver's powers ready to go, all she needs is a group of competent but disposable patsies who can steal the Eiidon back during the short window of time it's powers will be suppressed. Of course they might have to take the fall for her, but that doesn't matter to her. Once she has the Elidon she can finally feed The Intelligence to the Weaver, and gain supernatural luck beyond reckoning, and perhaps, immortality. With a tiny catch, because the crystal is already implanted in her skull, doing so without killing herself requires a complex ritual, one activated by a moment of fated destiny, like say... winning the election for Supreme Adjudicator.</p>

<h4>What does she desire?</h4>
<p>Lana's ambitions are not modest. She is going to enslave the Weaver, assume its powers, and become immortal. She is single minded in her devotion to her plan, and while she's superficially pretended to be vain, and to care for earthly desires, those are masks she wears to put others at ease, to make them think she can be controlled. Lana will not be stopped by anything or anyone. Her single minded devotion to this goal can be twisted to manipulate her by someone clever enough to threaten her plans, but Lana is best thought of as an unstoppable force. She is inexorable.</p>

<p>There are two things that can stop her, wrecking her plans to a degree that they can not be recovered (destroying the Elidon. Exposing her as a Demonologist and forcing the authorities to take her in. Revealing her double game to the Brazzacot Institute.) or killing her. Anything short of that, and she will try to find a way to salvage her plan, no matter how unlikely. She will, however, happily *pretend* to be controlled or manipulated, if it will let her stay in the game.</p>

<p>To bring her husband along on her ascension. She says she doesn't like the man but he's been an erstwhile ally, and has grown on her.</p>

<h4>What does she despise?</h4>
<p>Small minded people, which is really everyone other than her. She doesn't think of people as people, but rather as chess pieces, to be twirled around the board. She despises Monamon, of course, because he was given every opportunity to use the Elidon and he's barely scratched the surface of its potential.</p>

<p>She won't admit it but she despises herself. She's running on all cylinders to keep this plan going, and the amount of balls in the air leave no time for self reflection, but she's terrified that she's not enough to make this work, and hates herself for the terror and the insufficiency.</p>

<p>Having to juggle what she transmits with the crystal. She's brilliant, analytical and now trapped in a hive mind of lesser people all of which think they're just as brilliant. The thought that she might be like them is killing her. It's like being hooked to a twitter feed of idiots with a superiority complex. If she didn't need it for the ritual she'd take it out with a knife right now.</p>

<p>This entire election game. She was supposed to be done with this, with playing politics, looking nice. She was supposed to have ascended to power, and instead she's sitting through another speech, trying to convince another wealthy donor, having to consider Amelia of all people an equal and smile through her platitudes. All to have the world's most ambitious and insufferable moron running away with the election because of her creation. The thought of losing to any of them? Unacceptable.</p>

<h4>What can you take from her?</h4>
<p>Lana is one of the most experienced demonologists in the Spire, and knows pretty much everything about Monamons Elidon, having made it herself. She knows rituals to neutralize it, both non-violently and through a forced manifestation. She can provide extensive knowledge about the Brazzacot Institute as well as all kinds of favors from them. She's wildly knowledgeable about intelligence, distributed and otherwise. She also has an appalling amount of personal wealth. Her connections in the Sisterhood of Illumination are more than willing to assassinate, steal and worse on her behalf as well. Her husband is well connected and respects their "business arrangement" and is a great way to get involved with the Drow nobility.</p>

<div class="spire-sidebar">
<h3>THE RITUALS</h3>
<p>Lana has two ways to deal with the Elidon she created: suppress it temporarily, or force the demon out entirely.</p>

<p>The suppression ritual is the careful approach. It needs time, specific materials, and someone who knows what they're doing. When it works, Monamon's supernatural luck goes away for a limited window (decide how long based on dramatic timing: anywhere from hours to a day). This gives players an opening to act against him without reality bending in his favor.</p>

<p>The forced manifestation is the nuclear option. It tears the demon out of the Elidon and makes it physically real. This is a manifestation event. Hundreds or thousands will die. Monamon himself will almost certainly be torn apart if he is nearby. This will derail the entire election as exorcists investigate and the district is shut down.</p>

<p>Lana is not the only one who understands demonology. The librarians, other demonologists in the Conservatory, the various secret organizations, and even the Solar Paladins all have ways of dealing with or suppressing demons. Taking out Monamon's demonic help is a major plot beat so it should not be easy or effortless. Make them earn it.</p>
</div>

<h4>Suggested Scenes</h4>

<ol>
<li><strong>The players are at a gala.</strong> The word on the street is that Monamon is going to present his daughter, and she's going to official announce the Student Union vote, and everyone *knows* it's going to go to Monamon. Everyone has arrived, and Monamon and Aurelia will surely make an entrance soon... Everyone sees the ephemeral Lady Wind-Blows-Petals-Softly and Lana talking, and Lady Wind-Blows-Petals-Softly turn from Lana, and with a single swift move, slap her fiancee. It resounds like thunder in the ballroom, interrupting quiet conversation. "ADULTERER. DROW LOVING ADULTERER" she shrieks, as she storms off, clearly sobbing. Lord Wind-Blows-Petals-Softly is still reeling on the floor, everyone is watching. Lana has faded into the background. The whisper campaign is already forming, gossipers following the injured Lady, several of Lord's Wind-Blows-Petals-Softly friends helping him up, others staying away. A reporter is furiously taking notes. Half the staff has vanished, the other is madly serving canapes. A befuddled Monamon has just made his entrance, barely noticed.</li>

<li><strong>Lana is giving a public speech.</strong> She looks radiant, attired formally, and her speech is controlled and inspiring, talking about how the Conservatory deserves strong visionary leadership. She's careful not to name any names but it paints Monamon as privileged and blind. The speech is clearly aimed at the faculty more than the students. Viper is watching from the sidelines, looking like a bored adjunct professor.</li>

<li><strong>Lana learns about the players because they've collected too much heat.</strong>  Maybe as a shadow fallout and sends a messenger to contact them, letting them know that she's open to working with the ministry. Ff they're willing to do a job for her. They can discuss specific terms at the House of Hollows.</li>

<li><strong>The players see an arrest in progress.</strong> A member of the sisterhood is being brought in by Solar Paladins. Part of the side of the dorm collapses and obvious demonological papers are fluttering down to the street as the sister attempts to make her escape. Watching the chaos unfold from the building across the street is one of Lana's agents, someone the players have seen with her before.</li>

<li><strong>The players see Lana departing a carriage, about to enter one of the many galas leading up to the vote.</strong> A hostile student reporter almost assaults her, pushing through her two guards, asking her furious questions. Lana raises a hand and stops her bodyguard from tackling the student. She handles the conversation with an almost inhuman grace, and in less than four or five exchanges the reporter's entire demeanor seems to have changed, as if ensorcered.</li>

<h3>Jakob Icicles-Sing-Of-Spring (The Tower)</h3>

<h4>Why is he important?</h4>
<p>Jakob is a brilliant intellectual with a history of philanthropy, and genuinely caring about the future of the conservatory above and beyond just superficial appearance, often agitating for both the rights of students and drow. He is universally beloved by the student body outside of the University of Arcane magic, and he's been trying for years to have the conservatory ban the barbarous practices of the department of athletics.</p>

<p>He's also stark raving mad, and embarked on a one-man mission to resurrect The Spire and have it act as a gateway to other dimensions. A doomed idea based on a book that he can't even fully understand.</p>

<h4>What sets him apart from the other professors?</h4>
<p>Besides being unorthodoxly pro-student part of the establishment, Jakob is a member of the Spire Ascendant, he's following the instructions of a holy text called the Lapis Cruentus. The book is esoteric, difficult to translate and requires a lot of very specific and strange rituals to be fulfilled. He is following these slavishly and trying to translate as much of the book as possible, all while ensuring he has the resources to continue his research.</p>

<p>At some point, he believed all the things about students rights, and equality that he now uses as a lever to get more influence and gather the followers he needs to prepare the grandest of rituals. Most of the other candidates think him an idealistic fool, or at worst a middling nuisance, but Jakob's devotion to his objectives is very real and he is willing to engage in any kind of skulduggery to ensure the vast resources of the conservatory are put at the disposal of his agenda.</p>

<p>Before he discovered the Lapis he was having a steamy, passionate affair with one of his drow students, a bombshell that could have destroyed his reputation. With his new obsession he dropped the relationship abruptly and quietly, leaving behind a broken heart and a student who's very much a loose end.</p>

<h4>What does he desire?</h4>
<p>To follow all the steps outlined in the Lapis Cruentus, a book he stole from The Library, much to the wrath of the Librarians. With it he will awaken the Ghost Within The City which will Open the Seventh Seal and Compel The Gate Animate. He believes, deep in his core, that this is the single most important task in his, or anyone's life, and he's embraced this with the pure religious fanaticism that is only possible after having seen your hopes and dreams completely crumble to dust. He sincerely believes this will save the students, now and forever, and he's doing it for everyone's good.</p>

<p>He'd also like to keep the students mostly safe now of course, his care for their mortal concerns might have become a secondary priority, but at one point he did deeply care about their health and well being, even if now he tells himself he doesn't.</p>

<p>To spend more time with his students. The rituals, the campaigning, the needing to win, it's taken him away from what he's always enjoyed, teaching.</p>

<h4>What does he despise?</h4>
<p>Everything in this putrid system. He sees the conservatory for what it is: a system of education that runs on the blood of the students it's meant to protect, its gears mulching the corpses of endless failures so that a few can grease their palms, and maintain their system of power. He's beyond caring about bringing it down, specifically, since once The Eighth Seal is Sundered, everyone will become powerful ghosts able to leave the Spire, and get their own Spires, it won't matter, but he does loathe the entire system, and to some degree himself for being a part of it. The Athletics department to him is the biggest example of the rot.</p>

<p>Venmir. They've clashed more than once, but to Jakob he represents the antithesis of everything that matters. A man who loves paperwork more than people, who can't bare to seem to have a soul. Someone more inhuman than the Spire itself. He can disagree with people like Monamon and Rina, he understands their position of privilege but Venmir chose his role, and doesn't even have the decency to be a bigot.</p>

<p>Every single reporter in the Mezzanine that insists on writing articles that happily clap about student suffering treat it as a positive, that cheer on the athletics department. It's one thing to be part of a system, another to glorify it.</p>

<h4>What can you take from him?</h4>
<p>Jakob is the undisputed darling of the students and his connections there are incredibly strong. He knows a lot of what's going on among the drow students, and he's more than once interfered to help them out, either as a mediator or using soft power. He's also very well regarded as a researcher into the history of the Spire and has many fellow academics who would be happy to help him if he asked. He has more money than he knows what to do with, having fallen into academia as the hobby of a bored young Aelfir noble, and having never left, but not so much money he can fund the most extravagant rituals he needs. The few he's indoctrinated into his specific branch of The Spire Ascendant are personally loyal to Jakob's goals.</p>

<p>The Lapis Cruentus is an interesting ancient text, and some of the rituals it contains *are* powerful forms of Necrofusimancy, capable of compelling the spire to change shape and alter itself. Using this Jakob has been able to create a maze of secret passages and hiding spots through the conservatory, which could prove *very* useful, if somewhat dangerous.</p>

<div class="spire-sidebar">
<h3>THE SPIRE ASCENDANT</h3>
<p>A cult that believes the Spire is a living god that must be awakened. Most members are academics researching the city's architecture and history through the lens of necrofusimancy: the art of speaking to and commanding the dead city itself. In academic circles, they're seen as eccentric but mostly harmless urban archaeologists with unorthodox theories about the Spire.</p>

<p>What most don't know, the cultists are right. The spire is a breathing, animate, sometimes evil, thing and it can be modified via necrofusimancy. Check the core rulebook, page 86 for more details.</p>
</div>

<h4>Suggested Scenes</h4>

<ol>
<li><strong>Students are blocking a building to protest Athletics Department kidnappings.</strong> Jakob is there, talking to the very clearly itchy-fingered Provost Guards, but he calmly explains that the paperwork is all in order and that the students are behaving non-violently. His presence clearly keeps things from escalating, and he looks a little like a mother hen protecting her hatchlings.</li>

<li><strong>Players encounter Jakob in an unusual location: maintenance tunnels, between buildings, somewhere odd.</strong> He has maps, is taking measurements and he has a student with him who looks a little taken aback but not unhappy. If questioned, he explains he's researching the architecture for a book on the Conservatory's history. He asks one of the players to hold an instrument for a second while he takes a measurement.</li>

<li><strong>Jakob is a participant in a public debate.</strong> Neither Monamon nor Lana show up (Valerius wasn't invited, and Theodore was too drunk to attend). A rather dispirited Jakob gives a rousing speech on students rights, the brutality of the athletics department and the importance of gradual transformative change. It's clear he's given this speech a hundred times, but the students still cheer.</li>

<li><strong>One or more of the players who shows any amount of interest in the history of the spire or Jakob's seminars on architecture is invited to a private gathering of like-minded intellectuals.</strong> It's coded like it's going to be an anarchist meeting, but instead is very much a meeting about architecture in the Spire. If they can talk convincingly or show interest in the idea of the Spire as a living thing, they get invited to a subsequent meeting about the Spire Ascendant.</li>

<li><strong>Jakob converts an NPC the players trust to the Spire Ascendant.</strong> Someone who was previously a useful resource goes incommunicado, vanishes and if the players track them down they discover they're deeply immersed in some convoluted ritual involving the geography of the Spire. They appear half mad and absolutely refuse to return to their old life. Alternatively, a moderate-severe mind fallout could be a player being "convinced" by a very persuasive Jakob that the Spire Must Ascend and they need to help decode the Lapis.</li>

<img src="/assets/img/tarot/justice.jpg" alt="Justice" class="tarot-card">
<h3>Valerius Thorn-Holds-The-Winter (Justice)</h3>

<h4>Why is he important?</h4>
<p>Valerius is a respected Aelfir professor and head of the galvanics department, running as a third-tier candidate for Supreme Adjudicator. He's respected by faculty and students alike, competent, fair-minded, technically brilliant, but lacks the charisma and political backing to actually win. His campaign seems half-hearted at best, making just enough effort to be invited to candidate meetings and galas without serious expectation of victory. This appears to be the perfect role for an academic more comfortable with books than politics.</p>

<p>He's involved enough in the election that he might siphon a key vote, or serve as a protest candidate, but no one seriously believes he has any chance. Not even the Aelfir himself apparently, who seems to take the obligations of candidacy with good cheer but occasionally gritted teeth.</p>

<p>Of course this is all a mask. The real reason he's running is so he has access to all the information and gossip that even a third tier candidate can get.</p>

<h4>What sets him apart from the other professors?</h4>
<p>Valerius is an Aelfir from a minor noble family. One without the influence to protect their own. Years ago, as a brilliant researcher, his groundbreaking work in applied galvanics was stolen by a tenured professor from a more powerful family. When Valerius protested, the system closed ranks and ruined him. He lost his position, watched the thief prosper, and spent years rebuilding from nothing. This experience forged a core of pure, nihilistic rage beneath a meticulously crafted mask of calm reason.</p>

<p>While other candidates seek to control the system or use it for supernatural ends, Valerius seeks something simpler and more terrible: personal vengeance against everyone who's ever escaped what he considers "justice". He maintains meticulous records of corruption, theft, abuse of power. Every time the system protected someone it shouldn't have. Then when the opportunity strikes, he makes sure justice is served, making it look like student radical violence or random crime. The revolutionary groups get blamed, the "guilty" die, and Professor Thorn-Holds-The-Winter remains a respected colleague who just wants to focus on research.</p>

<p>Despite his all-consuming vendetta, Valerius still deeply loves his original field: applied galvanics. He follows the latest developments, mentors promising students, and attends departmental dinners. He just published another paper that some have called "groundbreaking", and no one outside of the galvanics department cares.</p>

<h4>What does he desire?</h4>
<p>To systematically execute everyone on his list: every professor who stole research, every administrator who covered for abuse, every privileged Aelfir who escaped consequences through family connections. Valerius has spent years compiling meticulous documentation of institutional failures, and he won't stop until every name is crossed off. His candidacy isn't about winning the election; it's about gaining access to galas, meetings, and private conversations where he can observe his targets and gain access to them.</p>

<p>To see the work of the galvanics department promoted and properly appreciated. Despite everything, he still genuinely loves the science. No one else seems to understand how useful the technology could be, how fascinating. They're too busy playing power games.</p>

<p>To prove, through his kills, that the system rewards the guilty and punishes the innocent. Every "unsolved" murder of a corrupt official is evidence that institutional justice doesn't work. Someone has to enforce real accountability, even if no one knows it's him. Its the reason his kills have been getting more ambitious, more theatrical. It's only a matter of time until someone takes notice.</p>

<h4>What does he despise?</h4>
<p>He despises the Aelfir's casual cruelty, the academics' backstabbing, and the bureaucratic shields that protect the powerful. More than anything he despises the mechanical bureaucracy being inherently unfair and biased, rather than rewarding merit as it should.</p>

<p>The revolutionary student groups he manipulates and frames. They talk endlessly about justice and change but accomplish nothing. Worse, their ineffective violence makes actual punishment easier, he can kill whoever deserves it and they get the blame. He sees them as useful tools at best, pathetic posturers at worst.</p>

<p>His various "allies" among the student radicals who think he's sympathetic to their cause. He's cultivated relationships with anarchists, reformers, and malcontents, letting each believe he shares their specific ideology. The truth is he despises their naivety. They think the system can be fixed or reformed. Valerius knows better. Some people just need to die. Worse, he seems to keep getting entangled romantically with students that see him as a brilliant visionary who agrees with them, when all he's been doing is nodding along. He doesn't stop himself because to some degree he's hoping they'll see through his shallow mask, but they never do, and inevitably they get caught in something messy.</p>

<h4>What can you take from him?</h4>
<p>Valerius has a massive, detailed dossier on every injustice he's seen committed. A treasure trove of blackmail, of information networks, of various ways in which the Conservatory does not work. It includes meticulous details on the personal lives of his would be victims, extremely useful to anyone seeking to spy on them. He's very well liked in his department, and has access to labs and grants, but is also wildly beloved by the revolutionary groups he's maintained contact with, which see him as a sympathetic idealist on their side, an Aelfir they managed to turn, not realizing that Valerius has been actively manipulating them. Valerius is also an incredibly skilled assassin, he's built an entire set of gadgets to facilitate breaking and entering and not getting caught.</p>

<h4>Suggested Scenes</h4>

<ol>
<li><strong>Players discover a body, a corrupt professor or administrator they had an appointment to see, dead in their office.</strong> The scene is staged to look like radical violence: revolutionary symbols painted nearby, crude execution style, manifesto pinned to the corpse. But if players investigate carefully, there are inconsistencies, the kill was too clean, too professional, the "revolutionary" staging feels theatrical rather than authentic, the group in question lacked the resources and the courage to carry out a hit like this, etc. Someone might even decide the *players* did it.</li>

<li><strong>Players infiltrate or attend a radical student meeting.</strong> It's disguised as a general gathering, an informal party. Valerius is in attendance, agreeing sympathetically with whatever the cause of the day is, saying just the right words with just enough conviction, but not actually giving any material support. He looks and acts just like what you would expect a spy or informant to act like, researching, investigating, never overextending. There might be some revolutionaries who are weary of the Aelfir, but by the end of the night he's won them over.</li>

<li><strong>The players need to procure something technical or difficult to obtain that would make sense for Valerius to possess.</strong> Their web of contacts guide them to Valerius, who basically accepts whatever cover story the players give with complete innocence and an enthusiasm for his craft and for science. If the players are forging a will and need a special ink, or need to learn about the vermissian passages, or anything else, Valerius would be a likely source. The impression he gives is of a naive nerd who cares more about his craft than the motivations of the players.</li>

<li><strong>Valerius kills someone near and dear to the players.</strong> This can be some form of Shadow fallout or just a dramatic thing to do. The target is a source they've cultivated, a friend they've made, an official they're blackmailing or even the candidate they've backed. It's a theatrical kill, the manifesto pinned to the body is much more focused on "injustice" and "corruption", there's unexpected symbolism.</li>

<li><strong>At an election gala or event, Valerius has to give a speech after another candidate, Monamon, Lana, someone with real charisma.</strong> He seems nervous, fussing with his notes. He gives a half-spirited effort. It's not bad, he's clearly trying, but his message is generic, bland, unexciting. There are barely any cheers, and afterwards the gossip in the audience is mean spirited and focused on how no one could possibly take Valerius seriously as a candidate. </li>

<img src="/assets/img/tarot/fool.jpg" alt="The Fool" class="tarot-card tarot-inverted">
<h3>Theodore Brightly-Bloom-The-Flowers (The Fool)</h3>

<h4>Why is he important?</h4>
<p>Theodore is important because he is the chosen puppet of The Red Baron, a major player who is using him to disrupt the election and secure a controlling stake in the Conservatory. He is a tool, being used, and when his use is at an end, he will be discarded. While he has no real chance of winning, his well-funded campaign serves as a chaotic spoiler, drawing attention and resources away from the serious candidates and giving the Red Baron leverage. The Baron doesn't want Theodore to win, he just wants him to be annoying enough that the other parties have to cut him in.</p>

<h4>What sets him apart from the other professors?</h4>
<p>He's a philanderer, given to wanton excess, always chasing his next boytoy and drink. He slums with the drow and discards proper society to the degree he can. Not out of any misplaced hatred for the Aelfir but because he simply does not give a damn. He's too egotistical to care about what others think, especially if it gets in the way of his next high. Or so it appears.</p>

<p>His profound lack of substance is what truly sets him apart. In a race of schemers hiding world-altering agendas, Theodore has no deeper plan. He is an empty vessel, which makes him the perfect, shameless puppet for the Red Baron's criminal empire. He's the perfect middle man, his ego makes him want to run for office, and his vices means that the Red Baron and his enforcers have a noose around his neck if he steps out of line.</p>

<p>But he will step out of line, because he can't help himself.</p>

<h4>What does he desire?</h4>
<p>Another hole to fuck. Another unidentified pill or bump of glimmer. Another bottle of the most expensive liquor. The awe and subservience of those around him. To draw blood in another honor duel. Theodore is not a complex man, he's a raging substance abuser chasing his next endless bender. He craves sensation and paradoxically to be numb to it all. To rub everyone's face in it a little bit. He wants them all to know he's a trainwreck and doesn't care about their opinion.</p>

<p>That'll show his family.</p>

<h4>What does he despise?</h4>
<p>The hoity-toity high society Aelfir with their fancy torture opera, boring galas and endless squabbling. He knows the truth, that it's all a tedious dance to whittle away the hours before they can numb themselves. It's exhausting.</p>

<p>Would be artists that think they can interpret the world. You know what the meaning of life is? Nothing, you idiot. They'll take your dreams and shatter them. Leave you broken and spent.</p>

<p>Those hopeful students, eyes a-glimmer, thinking they can make a difference in the Spire. One of them, Andres won't stop hanging around for some godforsaken reason. There is no change in the Spire Andres! Go to Theodore's History of The Conquest class, you'll see.</p>

<p>The guy he's fucking, whoever he is. What, is he expecting this to be profound? Sex is just a numbing of the self darling.</p>

<p>The Red Baron and his enforcers. Sure, sure, they scare him. The threatening to break his fingers again, their big guns, the gummy smiles that hint at violence... but what's the worst they can do? Kill him?</p>

<h4>What can you take from him?</h4>
<p>What can you take from the man who has nothing? His giant pile of bills at progressively less desirable bars? Dozens of scandals covered up hastily? Half a dozen honor duel survivors with a chip on their shoulder and a desire to see him into an early grave? A collection of more unsavory deals made to prop his campaign up?</p>

<p>That said he's a fixture at the boring Aelfir parties. No one wants him there, himself included, but his mother, Lady Brightly-Bloom-The-Flowers, insists. You'd be surprised at what a supposedly zonked out drunkard can be privy to if he's listening and for all his faults Theodore is always listening.</p>

<p>He also has friends in all the wrong places. The seedy group of student collectives that are fascinated by the Aelfir who slums it out with them. The drug dealers and those selling less savory experiences. The various dens of prostitution. If you need something illegal, unsavory or exotic, Theodore has a contact.</p>

<p>Dozens of expensive Aelfir relics he's appropriated from his family home. From ancient dueling swords to ornate party masks. They could be hocked for money, but Theodore prefers to keep them around to torment himself. It'd be scandalous if they wound up in the wrong hands.</p>

<p>A group of self interested hanger-ons who all think he's a way to get in with the Red Baron, and who he despises. They're all happy to do all kinds of things to garner favor. A couple of them are there because they respect Theodore as a teacher but they're the minority.</p>

<h3>THE FOOL'S JOURNEY</h3>
<p>The Fool is one of the most important cards of the major arcana, and it can appear in two places, in the first position, the zeroth card, as the beginning of the journey, or in the 22nd position, as the last card, representing the end. Theodore is the fool at the end of the journey, inverted, twisted, the dark fool. Your players are The Light Fool, the pilgrims at the beginning of their travels, experiencing the breadth of the Major Arcana. Can they avoud becoming like Theodore, doomed and lost at the end?</p>
</div>

<h4>Suggested Scenes</h4>

<ol>
<li><strong>At a bar, and it can be fancy or the slummiest student dive bar,</strong> Theodore can be seen partying it up, a group of hanger ons he's alternately ignoring and sharing cynical jokes with, depending on his mood. He's behaving progressively more provocatively and egregiously, making nasty comments about other people at the bar, getting in their personal space, asking for drugs. People are a mix of disgusted and amused. A group of rough looking students are beginning to take offense, and it almost seems like Theodore is specifically railing on them. An extremely unamused member of his party, a drow who looks world-weary and muscular, and bears a Red Baron gang tattoo, looks like they might just step in.</li>

<li><strong>It's nighttime in an alley, and a group of what can best described as goons is gathered around a limp figure, kicking the shit out of it.</strong> It lets out a mix of pitiful groans and moans, and a tattooed, rough looking Drow supervises. Anyone who stumbles upon this will be encouraged to move on. The figure is Theodore who's receiving a bit of discipline from the Red Barons goons after his latest infraction.</li>

<li><strong>It's a fancy party, one of the galas the players have no doubt been invited to.</strong> Theodore is there and looks uncharacteristically sober, a state he seems eager to remedy. He's not so subtly dodging social conversation and niceties in exchange for seeking his next drink. He might make small talk with the players, especially if they're disguised as staff or otherwise would be wildly inappropriate for Theodore to confabulate with. </li>

<li><strong>On the street, a clearly stoned Theodore squares off against an Aelfir with a savage wolf mask.</strong> Both wield deadly elegant rapiers, and it's very clear this is an honor duel, the street has been cordoned off and a member of the Provost's Guard looks on, face a mix of worry and horror as blades flash. The other Aelfir is clearly skilled, but Theodore, even in his impaired state, or perhaps because of it, is faster and more lethal. He almost seems to be toying with the other duelist.</li>

<li><strong>The players are buying something illegal, dangerous or esoteric, when Theodore wanders in, also obviously buying something of the same stripe.</strong> If he's seen the players before he shoots them a sly wink or a knowing nod. When the players see him leaving, its with a truly tremendous amount of drugs or a mysterious package. Later, if Theodore runs into the players again, he might ask them if they have any drugs, or make an oblique reference. He remembers.</li>

<h3>The Red Baron (The Devil)</h3>

<h4>Why is he important?</h4>
<p>The Red Baron is the undisputed crime lord of the Mezzanine, controlling its network of illicit trade and contract violence. He is not a candidate, but a kingmaker. His influence touches nearly every part of the election. He is openly bankrolling Theodore's campaign to manipulate the election, actively working to sabotage Lana Montegue whom he despises, and has leveraged deals with Monamon. He may even hold the original copy of the Supreme Adjudicator's will. </p>

<p> The Baron cares about the outcome of this election. The previous Supreme Adjudicator and the Baron were, if not close, at least cordially respecting each other's turf, and the Baron will settle for nothing less.</p>

<h4>What sets him apart from the others?</h4>
<p>He is a man of many faces; no one can agree on who he is exactly, other than that he cuts an imposing figure in red leather and that his displeasure brings immediate, brutal violence. Unlike the other political players who are driven by ideology or revenge, the Baron has no scruples. He is motivated purely by money and power. He has to be brutally clever and ruthless to wrangle the Mezzanine's disparate criminal elements while surviving the crushing pressure of the Aelfir. What he cannot tolerate is the idea of power slipping from his grasp. He's killed too much, hurt too many people to let his empire crumble.</p>

<h4>What does he desire?</h4>
<p>Order. He has power and money. He's committed arson, blackmailed dozens, murdered scores, in his gradual inevitable climb to becoming one of the most powerful figures in the Mezzanine. The idea of it slipping from his fingers is intolerable. He's carved out this kingdom for himself and his brother. He can deal with petty crime-lords getting too big for their britches, he cannot deal with a radical new Supreme Adjudicator.</p>

<p>He doesn't just want to be the preeminent crime lord in the Mezzanine. He wants to be the only one. He has a choke hold that has been loosened by the chaos, and he wants to tighten his grip again. He's even willing to put aside his intense desire to see Lana suffer and burn if that means he can keep his empire, as much as he despises her for the "shortcuts" she's taken.</p>

<p>Above all, he wants to keep his family safe. His brother Ignace is all he has left. A massive hulk of a drow who pretends to be deaf and mute (and isn't at all) and one of The Baron's best enforcers.</p>

<h4>What does he despise?</h4>
<p>Lana. A weak slacker who used her connections (and he knows exactly which connections) to gain power and influence. Who betrayed her own family, and who is willing to destroy this carefully curated order to achieve her own goals. He respects her as a threat, but wants her out of the picture. Not just dead, but suffering. A vindication that you have to fight for something beyond yourself that he'll never fully articulate.</p>

<p>Anyone who takes shortcuts, who doesn't understand the value of hard work. He grew up working the crop orchards. His durance involved grueling work turning corpses into food. He knows what it takes to get to where he is, and shortcuts just make that work seem meaningless.</p>

<p>The Aelfir in general. He accepts he can't do anything about it, like a sailor who hates storms. But he despises them like only a Drow can.</p>

<h4>What can you take from him?</h4>
<p>Money is the most obvious thing. The Baron has a ton of it, even though it's mostly not liquid, and tied in things like drugs, buildings, and gemstones. He has some fluid cash, and can get lots more if he needs it, but he also possesses most of the things you would want to buy. Dangerous drow who'll kill for money. Drugs. Weapons. Access to experts. Forgers. Blackmail information. All the things needed to run a successful criminal network, albeit one built on fear, personal loyalties and a sense that The Red Baron is smarter, tougher and more ruthless than anyone else. His reputation is his most powerful and most fragile asset.</p>

<h4>Suggested Scenes</h4>

<ol>
<li><strong>The players are obtaining something from a criminal contact, weapons, information, whatever it is.</strong> Someone low level but reliable, when the Red Baron drops by. The contact is visibly nervous, agitated, tries to interrupt his dealing with the players, only to be rebuffed by the baron, and told to finish whatever it is they're doing. The Baron can wait. He seems unbothered as he waits, humming an eerie tune to himself. Whenever the players later try to reach that contact they're gone. Rumor is they tried to cut out the Baron, and "dissapeared". Someone else has picked up their niche and player business can continue as usual.</li>

<li><strong>As the players become well known,</strong>  be it for spending a lot of money on something criminal, doing something loud, helping out too many students, (or moderate shadow fallout) they get a visit from one of the baron's enforcers. The enforcdr is shadowed by Igance, who continues to play the role of deaf-mute muscle. He's just dropping by as a friendly reminder that if the players are taking up criminal enterprise, that's all well and good, but they should pay the Red Baron his due, and respect the local rules. People who don't have a nasty habit of dying of acute lead poisoning. A real plague around these parts. He mentions the Sturdy Cow, in case the players are seriously interested in going into business.</li>

<li><strong>The players need something their normal contacts can't provide, something requiring real help from a major crime lord.</strong> A riot on demand, a way to access Monamon's vault, an invitation to some exclusive Aelfir party that matters to the election. Every person they talk to tells them there's only one person who can get that, The Red Baron himself. Who proves to be eminently reasonable. This is a thing money can't buy. A favor buys a favor. He doesn't even need their signature, he trusts that their word is their bond. After all, the only thing a Drow can trust around here is their reputation. He insists.</li>

<li><strong>The players learn that The Red Baron is looking for muscle for a job</strong>. The job description is easy enough. It's just breaking and entering and leaving some pro-student, anti-establishment graffiti and trashing the place. The interesting bit is the target, Lana's chief secretary, and the fact that the Red Baron wants to supervise it himself. If they take the job it's almost trivial and the baron hums eerily to himself the whole time. The only time he speaks is to suggest that they can be a little more destructive. If they don't take it they can later learn about just how over the top this act of vandalism was.</li>

<li><strong>Severe silver fallout, the players debts have been sold to the Red Baron, and he's declared they've "defaulted" on their loan.</strong> He's going to send some of his boys to burn down their last place of residence, shake down their known contacts, and be very loud and disruptive until they meet with him and hash out a "payment plan", which may very well involve something the players would very much rather not do. Or he can have Ignace break every bone in their body, one per sten they owe him. Their call.</li>

<h3>Amelia Laguerre (The Chariot)</h3>

<h4>Why is she important?</h4>
<p>Amelia runs the Athletics department, and is obsessed with competition for the sake of competition. A former athlete, she is the number one believer in the value of athletics and the importance of keeping it going, both for the sake of tradition and the benefits to the students.</p>

<p>She is also paralyzed from the waist down, the result of a tragic (but commonplace) accident during a game of chariotball that saw her in a three chariot pile-up. She is the poster child for the athletics program, having been minorly famous as an athlete and then used her reputation to climb the ranks of the administration.</p>

<h4>What sets her apart from the others?</h4>
<p>She's a true believer, she believes the athletics program, with the brainwashing and the kidnapping and the maiming and the death is good for the students. It gives them unparalleled opportunities for advancement, it allows them fame and riches they otherwise wouldn't have access to, it funds scholarships and programs that would otherwise go unfunded, the Aelfir allow these institutions because of the sports. She sees her injury as a mark of pride, something earned and that shows how valuable the program actually is. It doesn't stop her from training religiously.</p>

<p>Sure, she wishes they'd maybe do less kidnapping and brainwashing, but the students don't understand how their lives are being enhanced. She's willing to overlook the methods when the results are so good. She's deeply entrenched in constant bureaucratic fights with the provost, trying to secure more funding and more advertising. Especially for her official Athletic Performance Enhancement program. It's controversial, providing selected athletes with substances to make them more complete athletes (aka, drugs. The bad steroids), but approved by the Ethics Board, and legal.</p>

<p>She's also hooked on dagger, it's one of the few things that keeps the dull agony in her back to a controlled level. Her source is a backstreet dealer she sees semi-frequently and who she considers a friend, an assesment he does not share.</p>

<h4>What does she desire?</h4>
<p>To continue to expand the athletics program, and have it validated as a core part of the Mezzanine. Oh sure it gets a lot of advertisement, but it's all framed in the service of education, when in reality it's just as, if not more important. Students are proud to be here, and a large element of that is how well the sports teams do!</p>

<p>For Chariotball to be more. More intense. More bloody. More spectacular. It's why she runs the unofficial Incentive pool, paying athletes cash bonuses for spectacular crashes and injuries. She sources the money from her own side betting, some money she skims off of the less important Athletics programs and her salary.</p>

<p>For her wildly inappropriate crush, the Solar Paladin Armand, to actually agree to go on a date with her finally. He's twenty years younger and she managed to get him into bed exactly once, a feat she's eager to repeat.</p>

<p>She wants the pain to stop. Every day it hurts more. Some days she needs three bumps of dagger to get working. It at least feels better when people remember her glory days, and the way she led her team to four consecutive victories.</p>

<p>To watch more chariotball, it's when she feels most alive.</p>

<h4>What does she despise?</h4>
<p>Stupid annoying "safety regulations" that activists try to legislate every year. Yes, some audience members may get hurt, yes, some athletes will be mauled and die, that is the way the sport was meant to be played. There's no glory in these new slower, safer chariots, and if we take away the pole hooks we might as well not have chariots at all.</p>

<p>The various academic institutions that keep trying to sap funding away or act like they're somehow more important or relevant. Spoilers, the funding is here because the fans are here, not because of "alchemical transubstantiation" or whatever.</p>

<p>Those tedious drow separatists that are hyperfocused on fixing the "issues" with "the Aelfir". Things are the way they are, focus on what matters.</p>

<p>Having to come back to her cold, empty apartment where only her three cats await her.</p>

<h4>What can you take from her?</h4>
<p>Amelia is "close" with Monamon in that she sees him about once a week to discuss future budgets and safety regulations. The Aelfir listens and seems sympathetic and she takes that as validation. She also controls the various scholarships, the teams of "recruiters" in charge of "securing" athletes, by force if needed. Hundreds of brainwashed athletes. A not insubstantial budget and free reign over assigning events. Amelia can do a lot of things that she hasn't realized are in her purview, from shutting down streets for athletic events to kidnapping enemies that are inconvenient. She also commands a surprising amount of drugs through the Athletic Enhancement Program, some really nasty stuff. If she were smarter or more ruthless she could be a major player.</p>

<div class="spire-sidebar">
<h3>CHARIOTBALL</h3>
<p>The Mezzanine's most popular sport. As hinted, it involves chariots and balls. Two teams compete in a sand-covered arena. There are no horses in the Spire, so athletes are harnessed to pull the chariots while other players ride them, using pole hooks to strike a ball (and each other) while attempting to score. Collisions are common. Injuries are expected. Deaths happen. The crowds love it. The Blood Moon Championship is the biggest event of the year.</p>

<p>The actual details of how the sport works are left as an exercise to the GM if the players care. In keeping with collegiate traditions, it's ideal if the rules are long and controversial, the referees are universally reviled, the fans are intense, and there's at least one team that never ever manages to even win a game but has a devoted following nonetheless. Some potentially horrifying additions include having players whose job it is to run between the chariots to steal the balls, adding "clubbers" whose job it is to break chariot wheels, and basically anything else you can imagine to make the sport more of a meatgrinder. Audiences love blood.</p>
</div>

<h4>Suggested Scenes</h4>

<ol>
<li><strong>At a major chariotball game, players are in attendance.</strong> During a particularly violent play, a chariot loses control and crashes into the stands near where the players and Amelia are. There's immediate chaos: spectators injured, someone dying, people screaming. Amelia has been knocked off her mobility device onto the ground, and instead of fear or pain, she's laughing, cursing euphorically: "This is it! This is real glory! Gods, I feel alive!" She's struggling to get back up, still grinning, eyes bright, completely intoxicated by the violence and chaos around her. The athlete in question is impaled and clearly dying, first responders are triaging the Aelfir VIP who has a head injury, several drow are trying to limp away as the stands sway precariously.</li>

<li><strong>Players are meeting with a criminal dealer for their own purposes.</strong> Mid-transaction, an extremely buff athlete arrives. He's shaking, angry, storms into the room, terrifies the dealer and the dealer's muscle. He's ranting about how "The bitch cut him off." and "he needs his medicine NOW", and he knows the dealer has been "working with Amelia, so give me the MEDICINE". Knives are coming out and it's very clear the dealer has no idea who this guy is or what he's on about. He's Amelia's dagger dealer and knows nothing about the Athletic Performance Enhancement program.</li>

<li><strong>While the players are present, an NPC student the players have met before is approached by three recruiters in Athletics Department uniforms. </strong> They're professional, matter-of-fact: "You've been selected for a tremendous opportunity. Coach Amelia personally approved your scholarship. Come with us." The student is terrified. The recruiters aren't threatening yet, but they have truncheons and there's a transport cart waiting. If players interfere or question the legality, the lead recruiter shows the paperwork, it's all in order. They clearly expect compliance and have done this many times before.</li>

<li><strong>Players are in the Athletics facility.</strong> The administrative staff is nervous, whispering. Amelia is in her office, door open, clearly in severe pain and furious about it. Cursing, throwing things, yelling at anyone who approaches about "incompetent dealers" and "unreliable friends.". She's been like this all morning, her usual "medication" didn't arrive, and no one wants to go near her.</li>

<li><strong>Players are walking anywhere, during the day.</strong> An athlete crashes through a second story bar window and lands directly at the player's feet. It's obvious he was trying to land on the window railing, miscalculated and fell right through the window. He's mad, he's drunk, it's the middle of the day, and he's looking for a FIGHT, and the players are the target of his ire. His friend sprints out of the bar, and is trying desperately to deescalate, but he's also drunk. "Hey man, we can't get the incentive money if you can't play." he keeps pleading, slurring, but it's not working. A student is already running for help, but everyone else is giving the players a wide berth, and the provost guard is nowhere to be seen, though it's only a matter of time until they get here. In the meantime this meathead looks about ready to take a swing.</li>

<div class="npc-box" id="venmir">
<img src="/assets/img/tarot/hermit.jpg" alt="The Hermit" class="tarot-card">
<h3>Venmir The-Last-Drop-Of-Dew (The Hermit)</h3>

<h4>Why is he important?</h4>
<p>Venmir is important because he represents the power of the institution itself, made manifest in a single, cold-hearted Aelfir. He wields absolute jurisdiction over the Mezzanine through his control of The Office of Student Affairs, directing everything from grant funding to the Provost Guard. He is fully aware of the toll of suffering his bureaucracy extracts but is utterly indifferent, caring only that the system functions, and well. He likes Monamon personally, they're long time friends, and sees him as an interesting potential Adjudicator, but he's not the type to let personal fondness get in the way of cold calculation.</p>

<p>Without Venmir, the carefully mantained order of the Office of Student Affairs falls apart. He's always there, always answering queries, managing chaos. He is defined by his role. He has no hobbies because the office is his hobby.</p>

<h4>What sets him apart from the others?</h4>
<p>Venmir did not suffer a trauma, he is not the victim of some injustice. He is rich enough that he doesn't have to be doing this. His family are all befuddled at why he is in some "minor administrative" post instead of something more glamorous in Amaranth proper, which he could easily get. But Venmir adores his complete mastery of this complex system. The intricate dances required to keep the district running, the struggles over where each dime goes. In some ways, the election is very exciting, it's a crossroads, it means he'll have to work extra hard to show the new Supreme Adjudicator just how things are done here.</p>

<p>Venmir doesn't care for money, he doesn't care for women or drinks, he cares for his careful, deliberate systems, and seeing the agents of chaos crushed. He sees the Red Baron as another cog in his machine, one he's tolerated. He doesn't super care who wins the election, he doesn't see any of the candidates as an existential threat. He believes whoever is elected will be controled by the bureaucracy, regardless of what they want. </p>

<h4>What does he desire?</h4>
<p>To see his perfect system rise up to any challenge and consume it utterly. To see how it reacts to unexpected change and through his incredible mastery of the system, it not only overcomes it but thrives as a result. He's a bit bored, things have been stable, and while he's not the type to create chaos himself, he almost welcomes things getting challenging, because it will test his preparation and the systems he's labored to reinforce. Before he ruthlessly crushes those challenges to dust, of course. Winning is the core part of being challenged.</p>

<p>What he really wants is a challenge. An enemy. A nemesis. Someone to utterly crush and dominante. Something that will prove to him that the thing he built is flawless, powerful and inevitable. Someone who actually understands the breathtaking beauty and horror of what he has assembled.</p>

<p>For someone in his life to appreciate his work. Every friend, every lover, every potential romantic partner has failed to get it, and when push came to shove, he picked his precious system over them.</p>

<h4>What does he despise?</h4>
<p>Lack of artistry. He is, at his core, an artist, it's just his medium is suffering and paperwork. There's an elegance to how the Red Baron uses reputation and brutality that Venmir can appreciate. It's brutal but there. What he can't stand is the lack of refinement, the simple bumbling around of Theodore irritates him, not because it's chaotic, which he doesn't mind, but because it's utterly devoid of soul. Similarly Jakob is boring, he doesn't have a carefully constructed plan, like Lana and Monamon, both of which are functional if inelegant, he's just a rabble rouser, he hasn't built something exciting. Above all he hates the petty vandals and intransigents who would deface his glorious creation.</p>

<p>Anyone who gives up. He craves the fight, the struggle, the challenge. Anyone who is faced with a really exciting struggle and... gives up? That's infuriating. Venmir would give his right eye for a real struggle.</p>

<h4>What can you take from him?</h4>
<p>Venmir controls the bureaucracy of the entire Mezzanine. This is no small amount of power. There's the obvious muscle of the provost guard, including the ability to arbitrarily detain and imprison Drow and most Aelfir, but there's also the flow of money for construction projects, the grants for buildings, zoning permits, rules and regulations on how ladders may be placed, legislation on what may and may not be sold. For example, The Provost can seize control of any number of buildings as "temporary dorms" for a small "honorarium" or declare temporary curfews or emergency measures. He also has incredible soft power in deciding when offices are assigned, who gets access to labs and how research can be conducted. Venmir might be the most powerful person in the Mezzanine.</p>

<h4>Suggested Scenes</h4>

<ol>
<li><strong>Players need something from The Office of Student Affairs.</strong> They are sent to get Form 17-C instead of 17-B, which requires countersignature from Zoning (open Tuesdays/Thursdays, 2-4pm only), which needs verification from the Office of Provisional Assessments (open first Wednesday of alternating months). Each clerk is helpful and polite, each requirement is technically reasonable, but players watch other supplicants who've been caught in this loop for weeks.</li>

<li><strong>Players overhear Office of Student Affairs clerks processing yet another protest permit for Jakob Icicles-Sing-Of-Spring.</strong> "Just approve it. Standing order from the Provost. Let him have his demonstrations, keeps actual troublemakers occupied." The clerks share a laugh about forty-seven protests in three years producing zero policy changes.</li>

<li><strong>A small unlicensed student protest is going on in front of one of the faculty buildings.</strong> The students are chanting and marching. A single annoyed bureaucrat has been asking the students to dissipate and is clearly now out of patience. A dozen well armed and armoured Provost Guards have just arrived with truncheons and are going to "disperse" the students.</li>

<li><strong>Venmir himself is on his way to some important meeting.</strong> As he's walking a small stream of underlings hustle beside him, running scrolls back and forth, his work not stopping just because he needs to go somewhere. They pass a pile of drunk students, clearly passed out after a night of partying. Venmir sneers, and orders that they "be removed, for blocking the public throughway".</li>

<li><strong>The players arrive at the Office of Student Affairs on some business that is considered small but aligns with Venmir's goals.</strong> Instead of getting the run-around, they find they are ushered to a special line, which moves at a good clip, they get the form signed, stamped and whatever it is done within the hour.</li>

<h3>Mirena Stillwater (Temperance)</h3>

<h4>Why is she important?</h4>
<p>Mirena, and the Librarians are in charge of The Library. The Library is ancient, it predates everything else in the Mezzanine, and so the librarians predate the institutions here as well. The library was not built out of convenience or out of a desire to hoard knowledge. It's a jail. A prison. A lock around a gaping maw in the Spire, one so ancient that the very nature of the threat is forgotten. What the librarians know is that if this dormant god rouses, it will devour the Mezzanine first, then the rest of the Spire, and that the only thing keeping it dormant is the vast array of secrets and knowledge aligned against it.</p>

<p>She's also a key player in the election, her office and its secrets are key, and while she's backing the candidate she thinks is most likely to get her funding, Lana, her objectives and goals are the preservation of the library, at all costs.</p>

<h4>What sets her apart from the others?</h4>
<p>While most of the librarians are reclusive, mysterious, clad in veils, the head librarian is reclusive but very much the figurehead of the order. Mirena is distinct from the librarians in her charge. She appears as an older drow woman, wise, gentle, but firm. She does not wear the veil of her order, though her clothes are always at best plain. She seems to always listen patiently, but also knows what the speaker is going to say next. Her presence almost visibly quiets the room. She's measured, never saying three words where one will do. Almost dispassionate.</p>

<p>Because of her tethers to the mortal world, she's also more exposed than the other librarians. She has to attend balls and parties, is forced to indulge supplicants, and generally has to deal with every bit of bureaucracy thrown at her. Paperwork is no problem for the librarians, but face to face meetings are excruciating. Venmir knows this and uses his leverage well.</p>

<h4>What does she desire?</h4>
<p>Mirena is a caring drow who really genuinely wants what's best for the librarians and the students in that order. She's not anti-Aelfir as much as she is anti-suffering. She wants to minimize everyone's suffering, even though she accepts that sometimes that means using a few unfortunate students as blood sacrifices to keep a particularly voracious codex bound. What she'd like is to have the library settled, have the students quietly read in the library and to curl up with a nice cup of hot chocolate and a thick bodice ripper.</p>

<p>She also wouldn't mind having some time to teach Venmir some manners, having had to endure one too many meetings with him. Or Monamon, who seems to always talk over her.</p>

<p>Who knows, maybe a date with a nice lady her age? But that's a distant dream.</p>

<h4>What does she despise?</h4>
<p>Suffering. Mirena was an orphan, then a widow, then a librarian. She has seen every form of pain a Drow can experience, and her utter rejection of it made her not cold and dangerous, but warm and tender. She doesn't despise the Aelfir, she pities them, the same way she pities those caught in their own self-destructuve cycles. She can't fix any of it, but maybe she can make things better.</p>

<p>She is not fond of the monster at the core of the library. She understands what it's existence implies, and that destroying it would destroy the Spire, but she is nonetheless unhappy that it exists at all, even though she accepts her charge.</p>

<p>She is generally unhappy with the price her blood powers demand and tends to avoid using them if she can. She measures the cost and will pay it if she must, but she'd rather talk things out instead of sending a ghost to haunt someone.</p>

<p>She's professionally furious at Jakob, because of his theft (he should know better) and because she knows what the Lapis contains and is afraid of how he might use it. She's not concerned enough to take direct action yet, but she would very much like it dealt with, soon.</p>

<h4>What can you take from her?</h4>
<p>It is only restraint and a deeper charge that keeps the librarians from being able to assume full control of the Mezzanine. Mirena herself is a capable and powerful blood sorceress, with but a few drops of blood she can communicate with any other librarian over long distances, conjure ghosts, affect aging or inflict plagues. She can heal and cure others, and perform any other feat of blood magic that seems thematically appropriate. Within the library she and the librarians are a fighting force that can defeat even the solar paladins, being able to move instantly from location to location, move in perfect silence, cause passageways to confuse and befuddle and generally turn the library into a hellish labyrinth. Besides magic the Librarians also have the whole history of the Spire at their disposal, including powerful knowledge Aelfir would rather keep quiet, whispered secrets snatched from memories, and abilities to create perfect forgeries. The Library is bound by its own charter with its own entire complex legal codex and rules on how it relates to the Conservatory.</p>

<div class="spire-sidebar">
<h3>THE LIBRARIANS</h3>
<p>A blood-witch order that predates the Conservatory. They appear as veiled Drow women in white robes, speak rarely, and within the Library can seemingly teleport, shift passages, and make the building itself hostile to rule-breakers. Whether the Head Librarian is truly in charge, or merely a spokesperson for a collective or an older power, is a secret the Librarians guard closely. Membership is by invitation only, usually extended to students who show aptitude for blood magic and keeping secrets. Once initiated, members surrender their names and become part of the order. They're backing Lana in the election for better funding and fewer restrictions, but they're pragmatic. They'll work with anyone who serves their interests, including Ministry agents who prove useful. You should make them mysterious, reclusive and weird.</p>
</div>

<div class="spire-sidebar">
<h3>WHAT'S BENEATH THE LIBRARY</h3>
<p>The Library wasn't built to preserve knowledge. It's a prison. Beneath it, sealed by centuries of blood magic and architectural reinforcement, something sleeps. The books, the rituals, the library itself, it's all there to contain it. What it is is left entirely to the GM. It's best if no one ever finds out. Maybe it's a direct passage to the Heart of the Spire, pulsing with malevolence. Maybe it's a being that feasts on intelligence and knowledge itself. Maybe it's simply a dormant angry god older than the Spire. Whatever it is the consequences of it being unleashed should be catastrophic, and the closer the players get to the true center of the library the weirder, more ancient and more overtly sinister things should become. Walls dripping with blood, books that scream even as they're chained to the walls, rows of mummified librarians and cryptic warnings about things best left undisturbed. If the players decide to kick that particular hornet's nest they should not feel like they weren't warned.</p>
</div>

<h4>Suggested Scenes</h4>

<ol>
<li><strong>The players are traveling somewhere on campus and the fastest path is to cut through the library, a pretty much everyday occurrence.</strong> But today the library is hungry, and the familiar bookshelves and the muted noise of students gives way to musty tomes and only the sound of the players footsteps. They're lost, and the more they try to find their path via conventional means, the more lost they become. They occasionally stumble upon a white clad librarian restocking shelves, and the titles of the books are getting more esoteric and bizarre.</li>

<li><strong>At a gala, student protesters outside have gotten loud, chanting about reform.</strong> The head of security has had enough. He's methodically beating the ever-living daylights out of one drow protestor, and his fellows don't seem disposed to help. From the windows gala attendees watch, a mix of horror and fascination. No one is moving a finger. Other than Mirena, who seems to almost materialize outside, striding silently between the head of security and the protestor. The obviously pissed off head of security exchanges some words with Mirena, and the players can see her stop mid reply, taking a deep breath, eyes closed, as if composing herself. Everyone is watching, more security is arriving, the protestors are breaking through the fence, the gala attendees are mesmerized.</li>

<li><strong>While the players are in the library, the players see two professors clearly fighting over a book.</strong> They're yelling at each other about the waitlist, something about plagiarism. One of them draws a gun and fires, hitting the ceiling. Students scatter and flee, and the opposing professor draws a gun of his own. There's a chill in the air, a sudden stillness, as if sounds became muted. Three white clad librarians appear at the end of the stacks, almost seeming to glide over the floor as they approach the combatants, who are still yelling profanities at each other and clearly ready to spill blood here and now. One of them tries to fire, only to have their gun click quietly, a misfire.</li>

<li><strong>The players are cutting through the library to save time, the fastest path between buildings.</strong> They emerge from the east exit into hundreds of students packed into the commons. A pre-game rally. Team colors, chanting, stamping feet, waving banners. The noise hits like a wall. Someone's burning an effigy of the opposing team's mascot. Fights breaking out between rival supporters. Athletics staff working the crowd into a frenzy. The energy is electric, bordering on riot. A small number of librarians hang on the edge of the crowd, veiled, seeming indifferent, but almost imperceptively anxious. Mirena herself is on her way back, a sheaf of paperwork under her arm, a smug looking Venmir in tow, looking all the more exhausted for it. </li>

<li><strong>Things are escalating, one of the other NPC's plots is going too well and the players are struggling/frustrated/keep running into Monomon's elidon and haven't figured out its literally supernatural luck.</strong> Mirena sends them an invitation for an "informal consultation over hot chocolate". There she calmly explains that she knows they're... involved in extracurriculars, and that they have a common problem, and wouldn't it be nice if they could help each other, if only for a bit? She just needs them to listen, and they can do whatever they want with that information. She then exposits whatever information it is the players have been lacking.</li>
</ol>

<img src="/assets/img/tarot/sun.jpg" alt="The Sun" class="tarot-card">
<h3>Aurelia Calming-Wind-Of-Spring (The Sun)</h3>

<h4>Why is she important?</h4>
<p>Aurelia is Monamons daughter (she inherited her last name from her great grandmother via some archaic Aelfir tradition.) and she is the elected representative of the Student Union, the representative body of the students in the Mezzanine. She controls one of the votes for Supreme Adjudicator as well as the resources of the somewhat mismanaged student union and the various volunteer groups that it represents.</p>

<h4>What sets her apart from the others?</h4>
<p>She is a fervent, true believer in helping the Drow and in the fact that the Aelfir are not the superiors of the Drow. She is also wildly privileged to the point of total blindness to the actual plight of the Drow. After seeing a Drow student collapse from exhaustion, Aurelia used her considerable budget to renovate a section of the student dorms into a luxurious "drow-exclusive wellness spa," complete with imported elixirs and sound-bathing chambers. The initiative was supposed to combat burnout, instead it tore down affordable dorms and replaced them with a luxury spa that the drow students are "strongly encouraged" not to use by the administration.</p>

<p>Repeat this with her efforts to boost morale with art depicting the conquest of the Spire, her efforts to ensure more Drow participation in traditional Aelfir crafts, and every other possible thing that occurred to her. Worse, she's completely insulated from the results of her actions by a group of useless sycophants currying favor with her father.</p>

<p>She's not stupid, merely coddled and with no particular incentive to do anything beyond arrange token protests and fund initiatives and attend galas.</p>

<h4>What does she desire?</h4>
<p>To sincerely make life better for her fellow students, regardless of race and class, and to have her father recognize that his ideology is awful and hateful, and that she was right all along. She'd ask for a personal spa too but she has three.</p>

<p>To earn the adulation and endorsement of her fellow students and not their undeserved scorn over who she's related to.</p>

<p>To pass her Drow Studies class this semester.</p>

<p>Like any other college student, to party and cut loose a little.</p>

<p>To earn the admiration of Lana, who she idolizes as a drow who really captures her ideals, and who has everything together. She's written her a bunch of letters, ranging from condescending to wildly offensive, hoping to get to know her. She hasn't gotten much back other than polite letters from Lana's secretary.</p>

<h4>What does she despise?</h4>
<p>Her father and his dated, terrible ideas, and the Aelfir cruelty they represent. They have weekly dinners where she can barely look at him, and which often end in passionate tirades aimed at swaying an unamused Monamon. Decorum demands they have their dinners, but neither one of them can be said to enjoy it. Monamon however counts on his daughter not "disappointing the family" with her vote, and will absolutely threaten and cajole to get her in line when the time comes.</p>

<p>Jarrod, the jerk who stood her up, doesn't he know who she is? She told him she loved him! He's not even answering her messages!</p>

<p>Going to boring Aelfir balls where her father parades her around like a show horse. It's so archaic and dated. The only Drow there are servants and it's not multicultural at all. It's also so boring.</p>

<h4>What can you take from her?</h4>
<p>Due to the student bylaws, the student union is actually quite powerful and can mobilize students, arrange for protests, and make massive bureaucratic requests to curtail professor abuse. They won't do anything but they'll inconvenience the bureaucracy. More importantly, Aurelia is generally well liked by the student populace, because of her conviction and fervor, her many screwups have been blamed on the powers that be, rather than Aurelia. Beyond that the student union has a fair amount of money and more contacts than you can shake a stick at. Aurelia is also the daughter of a very powerful and well connected Aelfir, she can get things done and generally access contacts that are out of reach for nearly everyone else.</p>

<h4>Suggested Scenes</h4>

<ol>
<li><strong>The players run into a booth on the street, manned by Aurelia and her "friends".</strong> She is actively and brightly asking for volunteers to help with stories of their drow heritage. Just a five minute interview. It becomes rather obvious rather quickly that Aurelia and her friends are more interested in speaking than listening, and they editorialize every word out of the volunteers mouth. The provost guards near the booth are "helping" volunteers decide to participate.</li>

<li><strong>In a public venue, a party, a street, Aurelia's piercing voice cuts through the air.</strong> Aurelia is very visibly irately yelling at a Provost Guard who was in the process of arresting a disruptive student "artist" who was doing something sufficiently transgressive (throwing tomatoes at the party goers, painting over an Aelfir mural). Aurelia is furious at the "obvious brutality" on display. She spots the players, sees a clear example of the drow underclass and grabs one by the arm: "See? Ask THEM! Tell him what it's like!" She's using them as evidence in her argument, making them props in her performance without asking. There's a bemused crowd, the guard is both confused and irritated, the perpetrator is looking to make a break for it, and the guard's boss is obviously on the way.</li>

<li><strong>At a party, gala, or other appropriately social event, Aurelia is obviously "on display" with her father Monamon.</strong> The two are clearly not getting along. There's a lot of rolled eyes, snide comments, and at some point, Aurelia throws a drink in her father's face and storms off and goes to cry on a secluded balcony. It's very clear that they're arguing about the upcoming vote.</li>

<li><strong>Aurelia hears that one or more of the players have been "helping students", perhaps as a shadow fallout, or if they just get in her way.</strong> She sends a gilded invitation carried by a masked servant to invite them to a "small gathering" of "deeply involved students" who want to "better the drow cause". The party itself seems to entirely consist of various people trying to curry favor with Aurelia, a couple spies sent by her father to keep an eye on her, and absolutely no one other than Aurelia who cares about the "plight of the drow". Aurelia's latest initiative is widely applauded and she's given several letters of appreciation that were clearly not written by drow students.</li>

<li><strong>The players find a dead body, dumped somewhere innocent enough, a back alley, a dumpster, anywhere that you might conveniently dump a body.</strong> It's a young drow student, a quick inspection of his stuff reveals his name is Jarrod, two letters from Aurelia. He was part way through writing a response, a very typical "Dear Jane" letter breaking up with her, when he met his untimely end. It's very clear he was murdered.</li>

<img src="/assets/img/tarot/heirophant.jpg" alt="The Hierophant" class="tarot-card">
<h3>Rina Still-Lies-The-Snow (The Hierophant)</h3>

<h4>Why is she important?</h4>
<p>Rina controls the Ethics Board's vote and commands a small force of Solar Paladins who censor, investigate, and "correct" ideological deviation in the Conservatory. After the previous Board member's scandal (caught in bed with both a student and professor), the powers in Amarath needed someone unquestionably traditional to restore moral authority. They chose Rina, an ancient Aelfir with vast experience teaching Solar Pantheon doctrine and "promoted" her to clean up the Mezzanine's moral decay. The appointment was a few years ago. She's still adjusting.</p>

<h4>What sets her apart from the others?</h4>
<p>She was raised in an era where the trend was that proper Aelfir ladies spoke softly, offered tea, and never raised their voices. This doesn't mean she's weak. She'll censor your research with a gentle smile, drag you to "correction" with patient regret, and destroy your career with perfect politeness. This is how things are properly done.</p>

<p>Her "promotion" came with a skeleton staff and overwhelming responsibility. The Brazzcot Institute alone generates more heresy than she encountered in decades in Amarath. She can't admit she's failing, can't ask for help, and can't leave. So she soldiers on, maintaining propriety while drowning. She has a dozen solar paladins and skilled financial auditors, when what she needs is eyes in every classroom. She has a hammer when she needs a fine toothed comb. She's determined to use the hammer as best she can, and she has been terrifyingly effective with it.</p>

<h4>What does she desire?</h4>
<p>To go home, have her servants brew a pot of tea, and never again lay eyes on a Drow who she hasn't explicitly called up to reprimand. Failing that to root out every last bit of apostate heresy in the Conservatory, execute about half the staff, put most of the Drow students back into durances, and have some proper order. Then maybe get a medal for her efforts.</p>

<p>She'll settle for a Supreme Adjudicator who understands proper hierarchy and who will give her the resources she needs, and who will ensure that people attend services of the Solar Pantheon.</p>

<p>Oh and to see her predecessor executed in some creative way. He deserves it, for sticking her with this mess.</p>

<p>One day off. She hasn't seen either of her spouses in over a year. She keeps promising to visit in Amarath, drink tea, enjoy a relaxing evening, and she has yet to manage it once.</p>

<h4>What does she despise?</h4>
<p>Jakob, Aurelia and any other Aelfir off actively betraying their race. At least Monanmon for all his relative impiety doesn't seem to want to hug and kiss the drow. The mere idea that Lana could possibly take a role belonging properly to the Aelfir.</p>

<p>The Brazzcot Institute as a whole. They have done nothing but generate problem after problem after problem, and she would execute the lot of them if it wouldn't take years to file the paperwork.</p>

<p>The awful tea they make here. She has to send the help up to Amarath every week to get proper tea, and they all insist on offering her their awful blends when she comes to run an inspection or have a conversation.</p>

<p>Whatever witch she pissed off enough to be cursed with this assignment.</p>

<h4>What can you take from her?</h4>
<p>The solar paladins are an elite force who can punch significantly above their weight, have a letter of marquee that lets them arrest and execute without a trial and are fanatically loyal. Rina's auditors can request unrestricted access to any document anywhere in the Conservatory. Rina herself has the power to issue a writ of arrest on anyone below the Supreme Adjudicator, can veto and cancel any curriculum, hold anyone indefinitely without trial and generally be a force above the law. She has access to the things money can't buy, like the influence of the senior clergy of the Solar Pantheon. A surprising amount of "technically not magic" and "technically not spells" courtesy of the senior clergy.</p>

<h4>Suggested Scenes</h4>

<ol>
<li><strong>Players are meeting with someone when Solar Paladins arrive and cordon off the area.</strong> Rina follows shortly after with her characteristic gentle demeanor and soft voice. She's conducting a surprise ideological audit of the building/area, and everyone present needs to remain while her auditors review materials and credentials. She's perfectly polite as she asks people their business here, takes names and takes sharp notes. The person players were meeting is visibly nervous: they have contraband, heretical materials, or are doing something that won't survive scrutiny. Rina hasn't noticed anything amiss yet, just methodically working through everyone present with that sweet smile.</li>

<li><strong>The players are in any of the fancier mezzanine streets.</strong> Rina is there, two solar paladins in tow, shopping for the upcoming electors gala. No one is happy about this. Rina's standards are impossible for even the fancier Mezzanine shops aimed at Aelfir aristocrats to meet. She's leaving behind a trail of sobbing attendants, censured establishments, and generally being an unbearable aristocrat with way too much power. It doesn't help that she's carrying around a stack of documents that she's working on "on the side". Word has circulated, and opportunistic businesses have sent "representatives" to "help out" and try to earn Rina's favor. The two paladins look like they'd rather be facing a death squad of crimson vigil fanatics.</li>

<li><strong>Players arrive at a department.</strong> The entire department is shut down, doors locked, classes canceled, no one in or out. Inside, visible through windows, Rina sits surrounded by literal carts of paperwork with her four Solar Paladins standing uselessly nearby. A bureaucrat explains apologetically that Ethics Board mandated curriculum review is in progress and nothing can proceed until materials are approved. Rina is manually reviewing every course proposal, research paper, and thesis. She's clearly drowning, visibly frustrated.</li>

<li><strong>Two solar paladins are engaged in theological debate with a scruffy looking second year student.</strong> They're caught up in the finer points of the Rite of Summer Ascending and debating if the consubstantiation of mana takes place through Father Summer or because of Father Summer. The student in question looks smug, but the paladin is clearly engaging with the argument, and obviously knows his stuff. The student the Paladins were in the process of frisking when the debate emerged is clearly too nervous to ask if they can leave yet, and wishing they'd just been arrested instead of this form of slow torture.</li>

<li><strong>An NPC the players like or respect has taken the fall for them (shadow fallout, the player spent the bond, what have you), and been arrested by the Solar Paladins.</strong> The players find out when they see the NPC in question is being publicly displayed in a cage in the commons. They're a broken shattered version of themselves, their right hand mutilated beyond recognition, clear burn marks all over their face, making only whimpering animal noises. A sign simply says "Heretical Traitor." A stone faced Solar paladin stands guard. After about a week or so the NPC is released, but they're no longer themselves.</li>

<div class="spire-sidebar">
<p>These are minor players you can use or not as you see fit, sometimes you just need a recurring minor NPC for the players to form a bond with, only to cruelly snap them away when they’re most needed or to use as a hook. The plot feels more connected if the same people keep showing up. I reiterate, you should not be afraid of having these NPCs make messy mistakes, costly decisions, insane gambits, and generally keep your game interesting. For every Remy that dies there’s six other bookies, and for every Noe that gets arrested there’s three more charismatic student revolutionaries. Use them like stolen cars.</p>

<div class="minor-npc-name">Remy Chiffre (Wheel of Fortune)</div>
<p>Remmy is a drow student who should have escaped his durance through pure mathematical genius. He won a coveted scholarship, aced probability theory, and had a real future. Then he made one bad bet on a chariotball game, took a Red Baron loan to cover it, and discovered he was too valuable as the Baron's bookmaker to ever be let go. Now he runs illegal betting out of student spaces: chariotball outcomes, athlete survival rates, election odds, anything with numbers. The Baron ensures he perpetually fails to complete his final thesis requirements, keeping him enrolled and trapped.</p>
<p>Out of desperation he turned to the luck-god Stolz, and Stolz has been answering. His bets keep hitting, even the risky ones. He's making serious money on the side , and he's convinced it's divine favor which it very much may be. He's eternally hopeful, certain he'll buy his way out soon, pay off the Baron, finish his degree, get free. He's got ledgers full of who owes what, knows things before they happen, and genuinely believes his luck is turning around. He always seems chipper, sweaty and like he's waiting for someone to show up and beat him up.</p>
<p>Realistically, someone's going to notice his impossibly good odds, assume he's cheating, and break both his arms. If he's lucky.</p>

<div class="minor-npc-name">Maurice Bezzle and Barnes Crisp-Leaves-Of-Autumn (The Lovers)</div>
<p>Maurice Bezzle is an unscrupulous Azurite, even by Azurite standards, and his companion is Barnes Crisp-Leaves-Of-Autumn, a disgraced noble Aelfir, run out of high society because of a series of scandals too minute for any non-Aelfir to care about (for example, his mask at the feast of high summer was grossly inappropriate. He used the wrong fork at the Centennial Regatta. He expressed the wrong type of enthusiasm at the torture opera. The decor in his mansion was tacky.). Together they run Noble and Barnes (named after Barnes' former partner, who died tragically), a one stop shop for everything a researcher or student could want, from caged monsters and decanted moonlight, to textbooks and "study aids" to tools for cheating and dueling pistols. Maurice and Barnes can't stand each other. They spent a lot of their time finding various ways to one-up each other by finding ways to become even more profitable, skirt the law, and sell something outrageous. They're both in it for profit, yes, but also to be somehow more notorious and successful than their business partner. The only reason they still work together is because of the shared deed on Barnes Emporium, their most lucrative business. If given the opportunity they will share outrageous gossip about each other, which is only about 50% true. If the players ever need to procure something of questionable legality (and when don't they?), or the team includes an Azurite, they should wind up at Barnes Emporium.</p>

<p>Beatrice graduated from journalism school with honors and discovered that no newspaper in the Mezzanine would hire someone who didn't have the right connections, no matter how talented. So she set up as a private investigator instead, trading on her connections to student publications and the more radical student organizing groups. She's clever, dogged, and has a nose for corruption. She's currently investigating everything from grant fraud to the circumstances around the Supreme Adjudicator's assassination. She's the kind of person who notices patterns others miss, asks questions people would rather she didn't, and keeps meticulous notes in case something happens to her. It's only a matter of time before she uncovers something that gets her killed, a fact of which she seems to be blithely ignorant. She truly and honestly believes that the Mezzanine can be changed, and is earnest in trying to get the players to help. Players can use her as a source of information, a way into student radical circles, or someone who's already done legwork on various scandals. She's currently neck deep in investigating whatever it is that would be useful for you as the GM to drop in the players lap later.</p>

<div class="minor-npc-name">Father Patrick Bellegarde (The Moon)</div>
<p>Father Patrick is the gentle face of an underground Limyé revival among drow students in the Mezzanine. He runs what amounts to a soup kitchen and study center for overworked and struggling students, providing food, tutoring, and quiet spiritual guidance away from the Solar Pantheon's scrutiny. Students whisper that he saved them when they were on the verge of collapse, that his small space in the Mezzanine is the only place they feel safe. What those students don't know is the price Patrick pays to keep his services running: he helps the Athletics Department's "recruiters" identify students who are promising candidates, pointing them toward targets in exchange for the administration turning a blind eye to his operation. He tells himself he's saving more than he's damning, that the students he feeds outweigh the few he sacrifices. He might even believe it. Players might find him a valuable ally for accessing Drow underground networks. He's also in a bit of a difficult position, as the Limyé revival is gaining a lot of popularity as an anti-solar pantheon movement of solidarity against oppression, something very loud that our good Father would rather desperately avoid. He knows what happens when you make too much noise, he's seen it happen before. It doesn't stop his fervent followers from secretly spreading the word, taking his caution as plausible deniability. Radical student groups have already latched on to the religious Limyé symbolism and are actively using it in protests. Father Patrick is only middle aged, but he feels ancient, and it's only a matter of if the weight of his double life will get him before or after the solar paladins do.</p>

<div class="minor-npc-name">George Danton (Strength)</div>
<p>George is a third year Spire Legal Tradition and Justice student. From a family of minor drow nobles, who paid his tuition so he could get out of his durance, George is quiet, intense, focused. He's seen injustice at every turn, one of his brothers fell into bad company, eventually lost everything, got caught stealing in Red Row and is still rotting in the factories of the Works, under a penalty durance of thirty years. He joined a revolutionary collective his first year, only to see them swept away in an Ethics Board raid that saw the lot of them expelled. A fate he only narrowly missed by dint of being ten minutes late to the meeting. George decided then and there that the system could not be fixed. If the penalty for debating injustice was expulsion, then there was no hope of fixing the system. It's not that he wants to burn it all down… its that he sees no other way around it. So George has organized, he's recruited, he runs one of the few truly effective student revolutionary groups, the Scales of Justice, half of them are members of the Crimson Vigil, the other half are Drow who've lost loved ones and friends to the endless grind of the Mezzanine. They all have one goal. To burn it all down and make something from the ashes. Unlike the people's collective they're not arguing theory, they're picking targets. They're not printing pamphlets, they're stocking gunpowder. They don't quite have a plan yet, but violence is on their agenda. Like the people's collective however, George has never fired a shot in anger, never quite committed a real crime in cold blood. When the shooting starts, will he be able to pull the trigger, or is all his praxis just a myth?</p>

<div class="minor-npc-name">Viper (Death)</div>
<p>Viper is the Red Baron's most feared and effective assassin, a professional whose reputation is built on quiet efficiency and leaving no trace. This reputation is the only thing keeping her alive. She was the sole survivor of the unsanctioned hit on the Supreme Adjudicator, a job she took for the money, only to watch her crew turn against each other in a bloody slaughter and the subsequent clean up ambush that could only have been the work of Monamon. She wants nothing more than to see him dead, but also needs to keep her betrayal of the Red Baron a secret, lest she face the consequences of slipping her leash. Viper is cool, quiet, and always accompanied by an albino ferret. She's not for hire, but the players are likely to run into her if The Baron needs something done well, or if she's seeking resources to strike back at Monamon. Her most recent gig is keeping eyes on Lana. The Red Baron hasn't ruled out using a quiet assassination to remove her and he has Viper figuring out what the best approach might be. She's on the unofficial Ethics Committee wanted list, Rina would like to ask her a few pointed questions about a dead Solar Paladin. Ironically, Viper has absolutely nothing to do with the Paladin's untimely passing, but innocence proves nothing where Rina is concerned.</p>

<div class="minor-npc-name">Tiberius Elonis Garnier The Third (The Hanged Man)</div>
<p>The scion of a small drow noble family, who agreed to go to college to get out of his durance. He barely avoided getting tapped as an athlete, and now he just wants to finish his galvanics seminar and graduate. Much against his will, he got elected to be the student representative for the galvanics department, as the "best suited to it", aka the only one who is slightly extroverted. This also means acting as personal assistant to Valerius and accompanying him to campaign events, an arrangement both seem to be less than thrilled by. He is doing the best he can with an unwanted role, and almost rising to the occasion, but at his core he is a student desperately trying to pass his classes, hoping his crush writes back to him and trying to stay out of trouble. Trouble disagrees however. He's been nearly caught in a student led fire bombing, had his dorm razed by Aurelia's reforms, and was briefly arrested and interrogated as a potential "agitator". Tiberius is not dispirited by this, he believes that when he graduates he'll be able to go back to his family estate and manage things successfully and his life will be back to normal. He's not anti-establishment as much as pro-student, and he believes in the efforts Aurelia is making, their intent at least, he's not blind to the effects they're actually having. Still he's using his newly foisted upon him duties to try to make minor reformist changes to the galvanics department, spending the shoestring budget on actually beneficial initiatives, and studying for his upcoming exams.</p>

<div class="minor-npc-name">Professor Lionel Trahan (The Magician)</div>
<p>A brilliant professor in Vermissian Studies, he has three dozen published papers, a gaggle of grad students at his beck and call and several promising avenues of research. He is a small, quiet, unintrusive and *intense* drow, often seeming to launch into unexpected tangents almost with ferocity. He's notionally the head of his department but he delegates all that annoying paperwork and people management to his adjuncts and grad students, much preferring to bury himself in research. He's the person to go to if you need some esoteric research on the deeper secrets of the Vermissian or the last train. He's also secretly one of the foremost researchers of applied demonology, courtesy of the Aelfir military industrial complex. Applied demonology is of course entirely forbidden and it would be a major scandal if anyone learned that about 2/3s of Professor Trahan's research is furnished by grad students so he has the ample free time to work on the research he's not allowed to publish, but which keeps his department swimming in grants. Professor Trahan is deeply unconcerned with morality, he generally cares for the welfare of his grad students and adjuncts and the students in his classes because disrupting them would disrupt his research, and that would upset him. You don't get to work in applied demonology without falling into some secret organization along the way, and Professor Trahan is of course a key member of the Sisterhood of Illumination, he was instrumental in Lana's plan to create the Weaver Eidelon and only partially responsible for getting it stolen. He just hopes Lana never figures out how responsible he was.</p>

<div class="minor-npc-name">Noe Gruet (The Star)</div>
<p>If you asked Noe to describe themselves they'd say they're just a normal student. That they are, they're also a radical reformer, a beacon of hope among the drow students of the Conservatory. Noe is here on a full scholarship because they're brilliant, and they're one of the most promising students in the department of theater and arts. They also run the student newspaper the Common Conservatory, which barely manages to squeak past the Ethics Board censors with its somewhat unconventional student written columns and poetry sections. Noe is a natural problem solver and leader, and other students flock to them. When the dorms were torn down it was Noe who helped gaggles of their friends and co-students to find new housing. When one of their professors was dragged off by the ethics committee for "anti-Aelfir sentiment", Noe led a study group that continued to study the banned material. Noe is a radical waiting to happen. They burn at the injustice they see day to day, as they desperately try to help others in a system that threatens to crush everyone they've come to love and admire. They speak with a calm, quiet conviction, which is naturally persuasive, like something in them ignites the passion of others. Noe understands the risks, they don't want to be crushed, but the injustice and systemic failure is unbearable, and they're already starting to take the first steps, hanging out with more radical students, attending meetings of student groups that are considered illegitimate, writing opinion pieces about how ineffective Aurelia's policies are. Noe is not quite ready to take the steps towards violence, but they've already realized that the efforts of Father Patrick are more than insufficient to help address the needs of students that are suffering every day.</p>

<img src="/assets/img/tarot/emperess.jpg" alt="The Empress" class="minor-npc-card">
<div class="minor-npc-name">Madame Sophie D'Arras (The Empress)</div>
<p>Sophie is one of the most successful drow graduates of The Conservatory's arts program. She was once the darling of the Silver Quarter, an actress so famous that she was invited to do various performances in Amaranth. She's aged out of that role, and while she could have retired almost wherever she wanted to, she chose instead to retire to the Mezzanine and run the student community theater (known affectionately as Madame's House). She cultivates the finest up and coming actors, and has been personally responsible for at least three moderately successful graduates getting their career. Among the performing art students, everyone knows that Madame Sophie is where the truly talented can find a home, regardless of their social stature, financial situation or anything else. She's been known to pay a student's tuition in full, or go have a word with a professor when a particularly gifted student needs it. She's matronly, friendly, boisterous, and has absolutely no patience for privileged hacks. She has a keen eye for talent and strongly believes that the kind thing to do is to dissuade the untalented with the full weight of the truth. What very few know is that Sophie got her start as a librarian, and indeed was initially tapped to be the head librarian. How she got out of that responsibility is something only she and the librarians know, but they maintain a cordial relationship. Sophie screens potential candidates who might not be suitable for the arts but might be a better fit for the librarians, sending them over with a letter of reference. Sophie is an institution in and of herself, and while she couldn't directly stand up to someone like the Ethics Board, she has the love and trust of an entire department, and a small gaggle of fervent haters who would like nothing more than to see Madame's House burnt to the ground and the Madame herself driven out of the Mezzanine.</p>

<img src="/assets/img/tarot/world.jpg" alt="The World" class="minor-npc-card">
<div class="minor-npc-name">Grand Mortician Harrow Dunstop (The World)</div>
<p>Harrow is an alchemist, a mortician and a genius. He's officially retired, no longer part of the morticians guild, and after trying out seemingly every other district in the Spire, moved into the Mezzanine. Notionally to be a consultant for various departments researching ghosts. In reality, Harrow is a high end broker for cadavers, immortality services and the true esoterica that is impossible to source otherwise. He also provides illegal maintenance services to the few undying in the Mezzanine. The biggest service he provides however is The House of Hollows, notionally a place for people to mourn the dead, it is the defacto neutral ground in the Mezzanine, a place where anyone can meet anyone with the promise that no violence will happen, and the rules will be enforced. Harrow has very rarely had to threaten anyone to maintain this peace, and his threats have not been idle, he has connections to the morticians guild that could cause serious issues for almost anyone in the Mezzanine, and it's well understood that it's best not to upset him. The mortician himself is not an arbiter or mediator, he merely offers the space, something that seems to tickle his peculiar sense of humor. Rumor has it that the mortician is a conduit for ghosts, a powerful medium. If he actually is, it's not a service he seems to be willing to perform. The mortician is one of the few sources of questionable services that sits outside of the influence of the Red Baron, a fact that doesn't seem to bother the baron one bit. For the truly strange, fantastical or morbid, there is no better source than Harrow. The drow himself looks nothing like your standard mortician, dressing in bright colors and flashing easy smiles left and right. The only quirk seems to be his insistence on laughing at things that can only be vaguely considered jokes. Harrow's arrangement will all hold together nicely until someone decides that Harrow's mortician connections are less dangerous than whoever it is they need to kill on neutral ground, or someone lures a mob of students to The House of Hollows to do their dirty work.</p>

<h2>Putting the NPCs together</h2>
<div class="spire-section spire-two-column">

<p>There’s a lot of NPCs, and the core two are probably Monamon and Lana, as the two frontrunners. If you read this document and have no idea where to start, Lana and Monamon is a very compelling central narrative. </p>

<p>There’s an likely arc, which is that players will focus on removing Monamon (he's too dominant otherwise, if they can’t control him or remove him their candidate will have no chance). Lana is a natural ally and likely the candidate the players will be inclined to back. This leads to a juicy reveal where their chosen candidate (Lana) turns out to be worse than Monamon and now they need to pivot again... But this isn't mandatory,  players might hyperfocus and steal the Elidon by session 2, or spend six sessions building anarchist networks before touching the election. They certainly don’t need Lana’s help to deal with the Elidon, there’s the librarians, other demonologists, or purely removing Monamon’s access to the resources to feed the Elidon. But one way or another they will have to deal with Monamon, he can’t be controlled or stopped as long as he has the Elidon. </p>

<p>If Monamon's still active and players lose focus, use him as pressure ('your candidate stands no chance, monamon controls 6/7 votes!’). Once he's neutralized, follow what players care about. If they're outraged by Athletics, Amelia's vote becomes critical. If they're investigating murders, Valerius is central. The plots they engage with become the campaign. By the time Monamon's handled, they'll have told you what matters through their actions and their fallout.</p>

<p>If they don’t remove Monamon, there’s no climax quite like trying to clinch the election from a candidate you know to be terribly evil and who has a demon of luck on his side. </p>

<p>The players will kill major players, have part of the district burn down, and generally derail your best laid plans. When that happens, ask yourself three key questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>What NPC is most pissed off by this</li>
<li>What NPC benefits the most from this</li>
<li>What NPC is most unexpected to drag into this conflict.</li>
</ul> 

<p>Then pick one of those NPCs and use them as the springboard for the next scene. If the players just killed the Red Baron, a smiling Venmir and his Provost Guards start to roll up the major criminal networks while Viper and Igance fight over leadership. Or maybe Theodore discovers that he’s just in the right place at the right time with his handler gone. Maybe Lana laughs and laughs and dons the mask of the Red Baron. Whatever happens, the cast reacts and things keep rolling forward. </p>

</div>

<div class="spire-section">
<h2>The Election</h2>
</div>

<div class="spire-section spire-two-column">

<h2>The Seven Votes</h2>

<p>The next Supreme Adjudicator is chosen by a council of seven electors, each representing a major faction within the Conservatory. At the campaign start, Monamon controls or has committed support from four votes, giving him what appears to be an insurmountable lead. The players' job is to disrupt that advantage and secure their own candidate's victory.</p>

<p>The seven votes are:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>The Department of Athletics and Recreation</strong> - Controlled by Amelia Laguerre</li>
<li><strong>The High University of Arcane Magic</strong> - The Aelfir College enclave, backing their chosen candidate, Monamon</li>
<li><strong>The Student Union</strong> - Controlled by Aurelia Calming-Wind-Of-Spring</li>
<li><strong>The Researcher's Guild</strong> - Effectively controlled by the Brazzacot Technical Institute, therefore Lana</li>
<li><strong>The Ethics Board</strong> - Rina Still-Lies-The-Snow's vote</li>
<li><strong>The Department of Library Studies</strong> - Controlled by the Librarians under Mirena Stillwater</li>
<li><strong>The Former Supreme Adjudicator</strong> - Via his will. Since no one has it, it counts as "abstains" but that could change.</li>
</ul>

<div class="spire-sidebar">
<h3>WHO CAN BE CONTROLLED</h3>
<p>The only candidate who really can't be controlled because they have an apocalypse plan, is, ironically, Lana, the one the players are most likely to want to control. Otherwise if the players get the Elidon away from Monamon, his position begins to collapse, but he's still viable, and suitable blackmail or impersonation would work. Jakob can be manipulated in various ways, especially if the players get control of the Lapis or resources he needs to complete his rituals. He can be less apocalyptic than the endings imply if he's the character's chosen candidate, because that means you get to show off another candidate as more insane/powerful/ruthless. Valerius is not a real candidate, but if the players can blackmail him and/or are willing to enable his purge, there's no reason he wouldn't work with the players. He just has slim electoral chances, but if the players can get him four votes, then that doesn't matter. Theodore might seem like a lost cause, but he's clever and if given a cause to stop his self-destruction and shape up, something to believe in, he could work with the players... until they have to sacrifice him to the Ministry or the past catches up with him. Finally there's always the option of one of the players or a dark horse candidate joining the race. Since only electors matter, they don't even have to be good at campaigning, the players just have to deliver the votes at the crucial point.</p>
</div>

<h2>How the Election Works</h2>

<p>The election is scheduled to occur in roughly three months from the assassination, enough time for candidates to campaign, factions to negotiate, and alliances to form. In practice, this timeline is flexible: you control how quickly those three months pass based on your campaign's pacing. If players are deeply engaged in running a student newspaper, those three months might span ten sessions. If they're efficiently manipulating votes, it might be six sessions.</p>

<p>When the election is held, the seven electors gather in Founders' Hall for a formal ceremony and what is probably the biggest party of the decade. Each elector publicly declares their vote in a predetermined order. Between votes there's drinking and speeches and ceremonies, and votes can be "amended" until the election fully closes (you get to decide how that works. It should be archaic and annoying). The candidate with four or more votes wins and is immediately invested as Supreme Adjudicator. If no candidate receives four votes, the election is deadlocked and factions must negotiate before voting again.</p>

<p>The ceremony is elaborate, formal, and public. Students and faculty pack the hall to witness it. This makes it both an opportunity for players to interfere and a risk if their schemes are exposed. In practice, the outcome is usually decided days or weeks beforehand through backroom negotiations, but last-minute betrayals and surprise presentations are expected. If it's not a frantic back and forth with hushed last second negotiations, and literal or figurative knife fights over votes, something has gone wrong.</p>

<h2>The Will</h2>

<p>The Supreme Adjudicator's will grants the seventh vote to whichever candidate it names. The original was stolen during the assassination and its whereabouts are unknown. Whoever produces a convincing will, real or forged, could swing a close election.</p>

<p>Where the Will actually is depends on what your campaign needs. Some creative ideas as to where it is or how to fake it:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Lost in the Vermissian</strong> - Dropped during the assassination team's infighting. Finding it requires exploration, dealing with Viper to figure out where exactly it was dropped, or more esoteric means.</li>
<li><strong>The Red Baron Has It</strong> - His people found it and he's waiting to see who offers the best deal, or to use it to leverage power at the last moment. He won't give it up cheaply.</li>
<li><strong>Monamon Is Forging It</strong> - Monamon obtained it. He's not happy with what it says, so he's hired an expert forger to modify it. Players can steal the forgery, kidnap the forger, or sabotage the process.</li>
<li><strong>The Librarians Can Forge It</strong> - Mirena's order can create a perfect forgery if properly motivated. They can also authenticate or discredit other wills or possibly find a way to retrieve the original via some kind or ritual or spell.</li>
<li><strong>The Infinite Library Route</strong> - A Vermissian passage from the Mezzanine Library leads to the Infinite Library where any document can supposedly be found or forged. Dangerous and esoteric.</li>
<li><strong>A Merchant in North Docks</strong> - The Gilded Hand pub has a Knight who claims he can reproduce any document. His price is a Quest: something significant and dangerous.</li>
</ul>

<p>Use the Will as needed for drama. If players are stuck, introduce a lead. If they're succeeding too easily, have an NPC produce a "legitimate" will at the last moment. The Will should create complications, not solve problems.</p>

<p>A forgery is only as good as its authentication. If players find the original, they can use it as-is or as a template for a better forgery, and expose rival forgeries by comparison. Authentication might be as simple as a librarian giving a nod, or as involved as three expert witnesses tasting the parchment and ink to verify it's the original. Decide based on the stakes. An elaborate ritual to verify a forgery can be super tense... or utterly boring, so choose what makes sense for you.</p>

<p>Multiple groups might present competing wills at the ceremony. Better hope no one bribed the authenticators.</p>

</div>

<div class="spire-section">
<h2>Endings</h2>
</div>

<div class="spire-section spire-two-column">

<p>I don't know how your campaign is going to end. Or even how it's really going to start once you give the players the dossier. Maybe your players are masterminds puppeting the Red Baron, or maybe they ignored everyone and focused on running a student revolution and the entire Mezzanine is on fire, or they all enrolled in classes and went to parties and forgot about the election. There's really no way to tell. That said, it's helpful to know where things are headed. You can work towards these, use them for inspiration, or throw them out and do whatever feels right.</p>

<p>Victory for the players, is of course, placing a candidate that they fully control in power. Ideally smoothly (as if). As you play, it will become clear which NPCs your players care about, so focus on endings that involve them. Again, if the players focused on Lana and Monamon ignored Jakob entirely, then it's unfair to spring The Spire Ascends on them... but you should certainly do either Monamons victory or the Weaver Unleashed depending on how they handled (or mishandled) the situation.</p>

<h2>Ending 1 - Monamon's Victory</h2>

<p>The votes are counted. Monamon Leaves-Fall-In-Agony becomes Supreme Adjudicator, and his first act is to purge his enemies. Solar Paladins drag professors from their offices. Drow students disappear in the night. His Elidon-granted luck makes him untouchable. Three assassination attempts fail in increasingly improbable ways. Within a month, the Mezzanine is his absolutely. The misery he inflicts on the Drow of the Mezzanine is unrivaled. Worse: his ambitions don't stop there. There is only one choice left. Take out the Elidon and then Monamon. Can the players make a last desperate gambit against the Emperor of the mezzanine?</p>

<h2>Ending 2 - The Weaver Unleashed</h2>

<p>Lana wins the election, and uses the election ceremony, full of intelligent brilliant students and hope as the catalyst in her final grotesque ritual. The Intelligence crystal shatters as the Weaver's Web devours it. For a moment, she succeeds, godlike power, perfect luck, immortality within her grasp. Then something goes wrong. The Weaver won't be controlled. Reality fractures around the Conservatory as a demon of fate breaks loose. The only thing keeping it from tearing the Spire in half is the sheer power of the librarians. Can the players rally a desperate effort to contain the Weaver or will The Spire itself be consumed by the gaping wound in the Mezzanine?</p>

<h2>Ending 3 - The Spire Ascends</h2>

<p>Jakob completes the final ritual from the Lapis Cruentus on election night, a ritual that is of course centered on the election venue itself, and which requires the votes of the seven electors to be cast "in duplicity". The Ghost Within The City awakens. If you like it can be the thing contained in the library, which escapes, or utterly unrelated. The Mezzanine's architecture warps and shifts, passages opening to impossible spaces. Student die and change. The Spire itself stirs. The Librarians are the only ones who understand what's happening, and they're terrified. Jakob stands at the center, convinced he's brought salvation. He hasn't. The only hope is if someone can snatch the Lapis Cruentus from Jakob and figure out how to undo the ritual. Whoever it is will need all the allies they've managed to cobble together.</p>

<h2>Ending 4 - Ashes and Blood</h2>

<p>Too many schemes, too much chaos. The Red Baron is dead, Monamon exposed, Lana's ritual disrupted. On election night, the Conservatory burns. Literally or figuratively. Venmir's bureaucracy collapses. The Ethics Board massacres student protesters. The Athletics Department stages a coup. Students take to the streets. It's ugly. Into this power vacuum the Aelfir are forced to take action, and what happens is a brutal Aelfir military occupation. Solar paladins execute dissidents. If Rina remains she's put in charge, and there are no checks and balances. The Mezzanine will never be the same. Can the players escape and salvage something from the chaos, or will they be first against the wall?</p>

<h2>Ending 5 - The Ministry's Asset (Victory?)</h2>

<p>The players think they have the election in the bag. Their chosen candidate has all the electors in their pocket. They even have a forged will. But no plan survives contact with the enemy. Pick the NPC they've most spited and hated, or an NPC they were interested in and ignored. When faced with losing the election, they throw out all the rules. Rina and her solar paladins stage a coup and take over the election hall, taking control of the vote at sword point. Students riot and anarchist groups pick tonight to strike and launch into violent action. The Red Baron conspires with the second place candidate and has taken control of key electors the players thought they had a handle on. Two different forged wills show up. Make them earn the victory. Betray them, have things slip out of control. When the ashes settle, if they played their cards right, their candidate is in power, and the Mezzanine is a mess.</p>

</div>  
<div class="spire-section">
<h2>How to Run This Game</h2>
</div>

<div class="spire-section spire-two-column">

<h2>What Is This Campaign?</h2>

<p>Your players have one job: get a candidate they can control into power as Supreme Adjudicator of the Conservatory. Well and not get killed/arrested/caught. And probably avoid too many horrifying casualties to innocent drow? And realistically to bring the hurt to some unexpecting institutional Aefir.</p>

<p>But there isn't a plot here as much as there's an assortment of characters thrown together and used as the backdrop to tell your player's story. The NPCs are going to run their own plots, they don't need the players. The players are more like a bull in the china shop of the NPCs best laid plans. Which is delightful, because it means any choice can be interesting.</p>

<p>Your job is to make their choices matter and have consequences.</p>

<div class="spire-sidebar">
<h3>CAMPAIGN LENGTH</h3>
<p>This is meant to be a pretty long campaign arc, taking place over 14-16 sessions, and culminating in high advances being unlocked going into the election endgame, but it can be played as a shorter, 6-8 session campaign. To do this cut content ruthlessly. The main three candidates can be run without any of the underdogs. The red baron is a key npc but you can excise most others, and ditch a couple factions, either ethics board the or the librarians are good choices. Forget any minor NPCs that you don't find compelling. Cut out any other major npcs that are not relevant to you. Reduce the required votes to 3, or have two of the factions already settled (e.g. the librarians are going to abstain no matter what), and feel free to take the will out as a possibility. Above all, make it yours. There's nothing wrong with a campaign about running a student newspaper if that's what your players settle on.</p>
</div>

<h2>Following Player Interest</h2>

<p>Players tell you what matters through their actions:</p>

<p>If your players decide the most interesting thing is running a student newspaper, then the election becomes about how that newspaper influences votes, and how it causes all kinds of institutional headaches and derrials things for... whatever npc is interesting. If they fixate on stealing Monamon's Elidon and then consorting with demonologists, that becomes the campaign. If they spend six sessions infiltrating the Red Baron's organization, follow that thread. There's no wrong way for them to play this.</p>

<p>They can try to ignore the election if they want, but the election won't ignore them. Let it progress off-screen. Have candidates approach them, desperate for help. Have whatever they're doing be right in the path of a candidate. Have their beloved NPCs be collateral. Things will continue to happen, regardless of how the players feel about it.</p>

<p>Similarly, the character classes your players picked tell you what kind of game they want. If your party is entirely a group of violence laden infiltrators, then give them a reason to break into the Bastion and Monamons office. If they're all cushy socialites, put them in a gala or two, and if they're firebrands and revolutionaries, give them student riots and injustice to fight. The Mezzanine has it all, you just get to aim the spotlight at where the players might want to barrel through next.</p>

<h2>The Living Ecosystem</h2>

<p>NPCs are not waiting for players to interact with them. They're pursuing their own agendas. This is what keeps things interesting. It's important not to move too many npcs at once however or everyone will become overwhelmed.</p>

<p>Between sessions, pick 2-3 NPCs who matter to what players are doing:</p>

<ul>
<li>What are they doing about the players' last move?</li>
<li>What are they doing to advance their own goals?</li>
<li>What are they doing that brings them into conflict with another NPC?</li>
</ul>

<p>If players engage with Jakob, his cult plot progresses and matters. If players completely ignore Jakob all game, his plot can be entirely sidelined and they're none the wiser. Not every scheme needs to succeed or even progress. NPC plots advance when they're relevant to what players are doing or when you need pressure. If players never engage with Jakob and you never need his cult for complications, his plot can fizzle entirely. Turns out his book was actually all mad ravings and no useful rituals. Did you forget about Jakob for 10 sessions but the players wronged him in session 1 and now you're out of plot beats? Turns out his plans were succeeding the whole time, and the Lapis Cruelentus was in fact one of the most terrifying things to come out of the library...</p>

<p>Use NPC schemes as pressure and drama when they serve the story players are creating. Otherwise, let them stay in the background.</p>

<p>Use NPCs recklessly. Let them make terrible decisions, get themselves killed, succeed at things that complicate players' lives, form unexpected alliances and generally live and breathe. If an NPC dies, and they will, there are always more ambitious people ready to fill a power vacuum. You have an unlimited budget and don't need to pay actors. So go hog wild.</p>

<p>When in doubt, involve an NPC the players are already aware of. It's more interesting figuring out how Lana is tied to the ongoing sports betting scandal than it is to make up some new unrelated NPC to mastermind it.</p>

<h2>Pacing the Election</h2>

<p>The election happens "in about three months" but you control how fast those three months pass. Three months is infinite time in campaign time. It can be one session or fifty five. (Please don't drag this out for fifty five sessions. Though I'd be morbidly curious as to how).</p>

<p>Think in terms of advances. Players should be making enough waves to earn about one low advance every other session, one medium advance every four sessions and one major advance right before the campaign climax. Advances are earned for transformative changes. So medium advances should come with "medium" intensity climaxes, killing a major player, discovering a major secret, causing major unrest. The big, explosive, intense, end of the world climax is the election. It might not be the end of your campaign, but it should signal that you're one or two sessions away from the end.</p>

<p>So when the pressure is right, then the election is tomorrow. If the players quirk an eyebrow and remind you you said two weeks at the start of the session, it turns out the electors called for an emergency rushed election.</p>

<p>It's the same with events. Do your players love galas? You can have as many as you want between them and the election. Did they murder half the cast and everything is on fire and you're out of plot beats? Election time.</p>

<h2>Remember</h2>

<p>When in doubt, raise the stakes, toss it to the players, and show them how the NPCs have been acting in the background. If the players are bored, look at the random tables, find an NPC suggested event, or simply throw some chaos at them. There isn't a single boring negotiation that isn't immediately improved by sneering gangsters with guns breaking down the door looking for stolen drugs, no heist that can't be made more interesting by the sudden arrival of Solar Paladins, and no well executed plan that can't have an inopportune case of mistaken identity.</p>

<p>Keep notes. You need to know what the players know, who they pissed off and what the states of the votes are. They don't have to be comprehensive, but they help a lot.</p>

<h2>The Cold Open</h2>
</div>

<div class="spire-section spire-two-column">

<p>You descend into the Mezzanine. The approach is breathtaking. Marble towers catching afternoon light, bronze statues of ancient scholars, the distant roar of crowds from the Athletics Complex. Aelfir in elaborate masks glide past, discussing philosophy and politics. This is the jewel of academic achievement in the Spire.</p>

<p>Then you find your door.</p>

<p>Fourth floor walk-up in a converted workers' housing block. The stairs creak. Paint peels from walls that haven't seen maintenance in years. Your neighbors are three exhausted Drow students who don't look up as you pass.</p>

<p>The apartment itself: two small rooms, a shared sleeping space barely big enough for bedrolls, a cramped kitchen area with a questionable sink. One window overlooks an alley. The sounds of the district press in, street preachers arguing, students laughing, the distant clang of construction.</p>

<p>On a rickety table in the center of the main room:</p>

<ul>
<li>A small shrine to Our Hidden Mistress. Fresh candles, a shallow bowl of salt, the hooded icon watching with blank eyes</li>
<li>A sealed envelope, Ministry seal in dark wax.</li>
<li>A folder tied with string, bulging with loose papers and clippings</li>
<li>Two small purses of coin (enough for a few weeks if you're careful)</li>
<li>Your enrollment papers for the Conservatory</li>
<li>A single worn tarot card. The Fool, numbered 0</li>
</ul>
<div class="spire-sidebar">
<h3>WHO IS G</h3>
<p>G is whoever you decide is the ministry handler for this operation. They're also running several other cells, way too busy to provide actual assistance, and aren't responding to messages. I personally enjoy asking the players to describe the last time they saw G as a group, and take notes. He likely won't feature in the campaign, but if the players decide to send a distress message or something, G might show up, to make things even messier somehow. There's nothing like having G arrested by the Solar Paladins or brutally murdered to really get the players sweating.</p>
</div>

<div class="spire-sidebar">
<h3>THE DOSSIER</h3>
<p>See appendix III. The folder contains 30+ documents: newspapers, memos, campaign materials, flyers. This is the Ministry's intelligence on the Mezzanine's power structure. Players should read these before or during Session 0, then arrive at Session 1 ready to compare notes and decide their approach.</p>

<div class="ruled-item">
<h3>The Blood Moon Championship</h3>
<p>The biggest chariotball game of the season. The weeks leading up to it the enthusiasm and interest rise to a fever pitch. Rallies take place in the streets. Students cut classes. Several gatherings of students start drinking days in advance. Getting a ticket to the game is a matter of winning the raffle, spending a small fortune, or being well connected. If you're not fortunate enough to get a ticket, the next best thing is to hear the commentators narrate the game over the bronze speakers in the commons. Jerseys and lucky charms are sold out weeks in advance. Moon-dogs, the staple and traditional food of the event, are sold at every stall and kiosk. The odds are meticulously tracked and fortunes will be wagered and lost. The Red Baron's bookies work overtime. Students paint themselves in team colors and get violently drunk. By game's end, someone's dead on the field and at least three people are dead in the stands from "celebrations." Rivalries explode into violence and more drinking. Aelfir VIPs have to be escorted to their VIP booths and the caviar service is spotty at best. The city guard is overwhelmed, drunk, participating or all of the above. Several bars are looted. Victors are marched through the streets. It takes weeks to clean up the mess.</p>
</div>

<div class="ruled-item">
<h3>The Smog</h3>
<p>Every few months, the winds shift wrong and industrial filth from The Works descends on the Mezzanine like a curse. Thick, greasy smog makes visibility nonexistent. Even gilded buildings look tarnished. The air tastes like metal, burns the throat, stings the eyes. More than half the common spaces in the Mezzanine are outdoors. Those without the means to secure interior spaces to gather or study simply stay home. A hacking cough becomes the punctuation to most sentences.</p>
<p>Professors refuse to cancel classes. Attendance is mandatory. The Provost reminds everyone that "adverse weather is not an excuse for academic failure." Street vendors sell questionable "protective tonics" and overpriced masks. Barnes Emporium triples respirator prices. The Library becomes the most popular destination on campus. By day three the infirmary overflows with coughing students. Eventually the wind shifts, the smog lifts, and the Mezzanine pretends it never happened. Drow custodians spend days scrubbing everything back to shine.</p>

<div class="ruled-item">
<h3>The Grant Announcement</h3>
<p>Once a semester, the Office of Student Affairs announces major research grants in the Founders' Hall. Careers live or die on these decisions. The results are the fruits of months of grant applications, blackmail, wheeling and dealing and navigating the arcane bureaucracy. The ceremony is an elaborate relic no one remembers the origin of but everyone follows religiously. Professors must wear academic regalia in strict hierarchical order. The Provost enters last, carrying an ornamental scroll case that's never actually opened. Three bells are rung. Everyone stands. Everyone sits. Rina gives her mandatory speech about "approved methodologies" while obviously wanting to be anywhere else.</p>
<p>Names are read in reverse alphabetical order. Winners must remain seated until all names are announced, standing early is cause for having your grant revoked. Losers must stay for the entire ceremony if you hope to get a grant in the future. For some legacy grants there's more confusing steps, like anointing the winner in oil. The whole thing takes three hours minimum.</p>
<p>Afterward, the real chaos begins. Winners throw celebration parties. Losers drink bitterly or prepare their vendettas. Everyone is preparing their next round of grant proposals.</p>
</div>

<div class="ruled-item">
<h3>The Festival of Reflected Light</h3>
<p>Officially a celebration of Limyé, the only Drow deity the Aelfir permit open worship of. Students are given the day off. The Aelfir consider it a harmless tradition, a quaint provincial superstition beneath serious attention. The Commons is filled with paper lanterns. Street stalls sell traditional foods. Drow students wear special ceremonial masks, dance, and tell old stories. Father Patrick holds services at his temple that overflow into the streets.</p>
<p>Limyé is only one face of the Moon Beneath. The forbidden aspects are woven throughout, hidden in plain sight. The mask designs echo older, banned iconography. The traditional foods have symbolic meanings. Tales of "the hunter" have clear parallels to Lekolé. Offerings are left in dark corners for aspects that aren't Limyé.</p>
<p>The Ethics Board has the festival marked as "approved cultural activity". If Rina understood what was happening she would have it shut down, but instead a team of solar paladins patrols the commons, watching the lanterns with disdain.</p>
<p>It's loud, raucous, and joyful, and a breeding ground for revolutionaries to recruit, students to put their suffering on hold, and more subversive sects to find promising recruits. Both the Ministry and the Hidden Vigil keep a sharp eye out.</p>
</div>

<div class="ruled-item">
<h3>The Endorsement Gala</h3>
<p>As is tradition, the Silver Chrysanthemum Society hosts a ball for the electors and candidates. This is notionally to allow each of them to meet the elite of the student body. In reality it's an evening of archaic rituals, backroom dealing, and exorbitant excess.</p>
<p>Attendance is mandatory for candidates. Dress codes are strictly enforced: Aelfir in formal masks and ancestral colors, candidates in white. The ballroom must be entered by walking backwards through the doors, something about humility before tradition. Getting an invite shows you're someone in the Mezzanine, and who wasn't invited is always the topic of endless gossip.</p>
<p>The evening follows a rigid structure. Dancing is mandatory and ritualized. Between dances, servants bring courses of food that would beggar the budget of most Mezzanine departments.</p>
<p>The real business happens during the "Private Contemplations", side rooms where deals are struck, threats are made, envelopes of cash change hands. It's considered part of the rituals of the night. Meanwhile, the ballroom continues its elaborate pantomime. Students perform traditional songs in dead languages. A shield dating back to the conquest is used as a punch bowl.</p>
<p>Servants circulate with champagne. A few revolutionary students infiltrate as staff. The Red Baron's people watch from the gallery. By midnight, deals are struck, alliances formed, and everyone's drunk enough to pretend the whole thing was dignified.</p>
</div>

<div class="ruled-item">
<h3>The Sorrow of Endings</h3>
<p>The Solar Paladins are, by religious law, forced to observe the Sorrow of Endings, where they mourn the temporary death and inevitable rebirth of Father Summer. This is not a small observance, to show their grief, they're required to dress in their finest solar pantheon regalia, ceremonial armour, the banners of the sun, huge bronze drums, and parade around the district, wailing, gnashing their teeth, making a whole show of it. The noise is unbearable. At appointed times they have various ritual observances. Ranging from logical (when night falls, everyone sobs) to obtuse (three casks of red wine need to be thrown and shattered at specific times). Worse, anyone who sees the procession is invited to participate. A huge train of "not wanting to give offense" students has formed, and various vendors have opportunistically started selling food,trinkets, and banners. No one understands the rites, and Rina looks <em>ridiculous</em> in armour two sizes too big for her. Students that were glad to get out of class are now worried they're trapped, and they don't know any of the songs. Various forms of "improper rite observance" are sharply corrected. The observance lasts for a <em>week</em>.</p>
</div>

<div class="ruled-item">
<h3>Crush Week</h3>
<p>One week each semester when the societies of Charter Street abandon all pretense of dignity and compete for new members through increasingly unhinged spectacles. It's called Crush Week because during a recruitment drive lost to time, rival societies began literally crushing each other's recruitment displays, grapes, furniture, in one case a small ornamental bridge, and the tradition spiraled from there. The week is an exercise in what happens when students are given too much power and left virtually unsuprvised.</p>

<p>Each society decorates their house and performs daily stunts of escalating madness. The Chrysanthemum drapes their mansion in silver cloth and stations members on the roof to throw coins at passersby. Aactual money if they like you, coin-shaped bricks if they don't. Someone always ends up in the infirmary. A philosophy society once turned their entire house literally upside down. Another filled theirs with bees. The theater sororities perform 24-hour plays where prospective members are dragged onstage as involuntary participants.</p>

<p>The streets become impassable. Societies erect temporary structures that shouldn't be able to stand but are. There's music at all hours, often multiple competing songs creating accidental cacophony. Students paint themselves in society colors and engage in "friendly" competitions that result in property damage, minor injuries, and occasionally someone getting stuck in a fountain.</p>

<p>By week's end, some students have found belonging and community. Others have restraining orders, mysterious scars, or recurring nightmares about interpretive dance. Several have accidentally joined cults. The societies consider this proof the system works. The students who survive consider it character-building. The ones who don't survive are rarely discussed.</p>

<p>Classes are technically still in session. </p>

<p><strong>THE MEZZANINE COMMONS</strong> 
Open plaza at the district's heart where students gather between classes. A mix of fountains and food stands, apocalypse preachers and benches full of students studying. Once, at its center there stood a gargantuan statue of the first Drow librarian. Only the legs remain. Four wooden towers were erected by the Office of the Provost to monitor dissent. They’re undermanned and stick out like a sore thumb. Protestors set up here weekly, and are usually dispersed by Provost Guards within hours. Bulletin boards covered in competing announcements, students arguing politics or comparing notes. Jakob holds his demonstrations here. The Red Baron's dealers work the edges. Aurelia's latest poorly-conceived art initiative is probably being installed. It's the pulse of student life, where you go to see and be seen, where movements start before they're crushed. It’s also where you’re likely to get pickpocketed or hear about the latest student fad. </p>

<p><strong>Barnes Emporium:</strong> A sprawling, chaotic shop selling everything a researcher or student could want; textbooks and caged monsters, study aids and dueling pistols, decanted moonlight and banned substances. Dozens of employees scurry between towering shelves. The store is half shop, half auction house, half casino and half house of ill repute. The shop can look perfectly legitimate in seconds when inspectors arrive, assuming they can't be plied with a bribe. There's always a mix of students desperately haggling for a rare textbook, sharp eyed researchers carefully carrying something dangerous, and bookish looking graduate students trying to get something to give them an edge. Depending on which of the proprietors is in, the shopkeepers oscillate between calling out and being pushy, haggling hard, or being obsequious and trying to upsell their wares. Players might see a caged heart, still beating, a map of the Mezzanine etched entirely in the skin of Drow, an "authentic" mummified saint, a dozen caged hyenas, and some perfectly mundane barrels full of teeth.</p>

<p><strong>The Library:</strong> It predates everything else in the Mezzanine and looks like it. On the outside the building is a grotesque hybrid, ancient stone structures with endless additions that look like they've grown organically. Stepping through the threshold is like entering another world. Veiled librarians appear from nowhere to hush anyone speaking above a whisper, and sound carries strangely among the stacks. There's an eerie feeling like time and distance are different in this place. Students study, singly and in groups, some studying contentedly, others weeping quietly. The titles on the bookshelves range from normal to bizarre to disturbing. Mirena Stillwater can occasionally be seen comforting a particularly upset student. Academics and researchers wander the stacks, carrying piles of books, or pulling a wagon with a set of stone tablets. Hushed but heated arguments take place over who gets to go on the centuries long waiting list for the only copy of a specific tome, and sometimes the fastest path to get to where you're going is to enter through the main door of the library and take a side door that goes somewhere unexpected. Just beware. The students and the librarians aren't the only denizens, and rumor has it the stacks themselves are hungry.</p>

<p><strong>The Office of Student Affairs:</strong> A massive brutalist shell of twisted metal, uncomfortable and unwelcoming. The bureaucratic heart of the Mezzanine. An edifice to the suffering it costs to run the Conservatory. Every grant, every permit, every arrest flows through here, and is paid for in hours of endless tedium. Clerks shuffle papers endlessly while Provost Guards stand at every corner. Getting anything done requires the right forms, the right signatures, waiting in the right lines. Or knowing who to bribe. The building itself feels hostile. Long corridors that lead nowhere, waiting rooms with chairs that don't seem to fit any discernable bipedal anatomy. Offices that move when you're not looking, or which are open only on the third Tuesday of even months. The Provost works from the center, the only comfortable office in the entire building, a spider in his web. Desperate students battle to get scholarship forms signed before the deadline, hurried professors grovel before administrators to secure a better office, waiting lists are decades long. The building itself almost seems to challenge visitors, as if asking 'are you sure this is worth it?'. Supplicants to the altar of the bureaucracy are armed not with guns and swords, but with encyclopedic knowledge of the ever-shifting rules, a dizzying catalog of favors owed, vague threats, empty flattery and precise name dropping.</p>

<p><strong>The House of Hollows:</strong> Harrow Dunstop's mortuary and meeting hall. It's a bizarre hybrid of bureaucracy and temple, squeezed between dive bars and an exterior that almost makes the building look derelict. The inside is impeccably maintained, the smell of incense overpowering everything. A half dozen secretaries process paperwork, direct visitors and generally keep the place operating smoothly. Quiet side rooms hold meetings and deals and allow loved ones to visit with the dead one last time before the bodies leave the Mezzanine. Small shrines to various approved deities, stamped by the Ethics Board are accessible for a small voluntary donation. Caskets carry both corpses and contraband destined for backroom deals. The doors to the mourning chambers are surprisingly sturdy and almost impossible to listen at, and discreet caretakers ensure no one intrudes on someone mourning or something more sinister. Enemies meet here, through gritted teeth, and you can spot gangsters who would usually shoot each other on sight stepping into the same room to settle a quarrel, along with dour mourners sobbing quietly. Low, mournful chants fill the halls from specially installed brass speakers that connect to the choral chamber below. A brightly attired Harrow cackles at his own wit as he mediates dispute and accepts discreet bookings.</p>

<p><strong>The Athletics Complex:</strong> Calling this a "location" is a bit of an undersell. The complex is an ever-growing sprawl of gaudy and expensive buildings, paid for by tuition, donors and the excitement of tens of thousands of fans who flock here to slake their thirst for a bloody game of chariotball. The chariotball stadium dominates, tiered seating for thousands, sand-covered killing floor, the smell of pain and crowd excitement. Athletes train under the watch of brainwashed seniors and armed recruiters, before returning to their specially appointed dormitories. Amelia is almost always watching from the stands, or correcting a coach, or generally making sure things run to her standards. The crowds are fanatic, the games are brutal, someone dies every match. Students pack the stands, betting on outcomes, cheering for carnage. Sporting events feel like a macabre hybrid between a celebration, an orgy and an execution. Behind the scenes training facilities ensure the athletes' enthusiasm matches that of the crowds, that there's medical care for the maimed, and that the athletes' grades aren't impacted, be it via special tutors, bribes, or simply having other students stand in for them in their classes. Where blood flows, so does money, and food stands, athletic gear, special events with the athletes, and bloodsoaked pieces of chariots are all available for purchase.</p>

<p><strong>The Sturdy Cow:</strong> One of the more upscale and ancient bars in the Mezzanine, a plaque claims it's the oldest in the district, a fact three other bars dispute. This is not the realm of poor college students or professors who must choose between textbooks and rent, but rather a place where those who have more means make themselves at home. The price point has made it the unofficial court of the Red Baron. Guests are discreetly screened by not-so-subtle gangsters, pistols casually displayed, drinks in hand as they discuss their grim business. Those that would approach The Red Baron to discuss real business are even more thoroughly vetted before being invited upstairs, to the VIP-only space. The Provost Guards know better than to approach this place, and even the street that holds the Sturdy Cow is surprisingly empty of any enforcement. Not that it needs it, few would be foolish enough to start something on the Red Baron's turf. The drinks are excellent, the food is so-so, and if the players need to deal with real criminals rather than street thugs, this is where they'll likely find themselves. The building is more complex than it lets on, having been built on top of one of the Vermissian passages, which serves as an emergency bolt hole and smuggling route for the Red Baron. While not the Red Baron's primary residence, he does have a room in the basement, complete with an office and a space for questioning uncooperative prisoners.</p>

<p><strong>The Bastion:</strong> An imposing motte-and-bailey fortress squatting in the academic quarter like a clenched fist, all white stone and solar banners. It was built to house a proper Ethics Board: a hundred clerks, fifty Paladins, the full apparatus of ideological control. Instead it holds Rina Still-Lies-The-Snow, eight overworked auditors, and a dozen Solar Paladins rattling around in empty halls. The grand courtyard designed for military drills sits vacant except for training dummies. Reception chambers meant for processing hundreds of cases hold filing cabinets and dust. Most wings are simply locked, there's no staff to man them. Rina works from the central tower, the only truly occupied space, surrounded by carts of paperwork she manually reviews because there's no one else. Solar Paladins stand guard at key positions, making the building look formidable even as whole sections sit dark and abandoned. Students brought in for questioning are walked through cavernous empty halls before reaching the handful of active interrogation rooms: psychological theater, making the Board seem larger than it is. The basement holds cells designed for dozens of prisoners, currently housing maybe three or four accused heretics at any given time. The tea service is impeccable, though. Rina insists on that.</p>

<p><strong>Madame's House:</strong> Sophie D'Arras's community theater. A converted warehouse with a proper stage, mismatched seating, walls covered in playbills from decades past. The Ethics Board has a perpetual "inspection pending" sign posted, yet never quite seems to get to it. The Madame always seems to be here, helping a promising actor rehearse lines, forcing a gaggle of students to do vocal exercises, dissecting someone's performance with the cold clinical precision of a surgeon. Even at night the lights are always on, be it because there's a performance ongoing, in rehearsal, or being set up. Several students who "don't live here" have convenient cots set up and eat their meals here. Professors occasionally make their way through, searching for a word with Madame D'Arras, or trying to track down a student. In not-so-secret, student revolutionaries meet in the basement and discuss a better tomorrow, or run illegal newspapers. Which specific group it is varies from week to week, as revolutionary leaders get arrested, fail their classes, or happen to fall in love. This week they're putting on "The Tragedy of Dumon" a comical farce that lampoons the trendy Drow Operatic Dramas. Next week it's "Revenge and Punishment" an Aelfir melodrama about loss and the winter pantheon.</p>

<p><strong>Father Patrick's Ministry:</strong> A refuge for the desperate and desolate, "hidden" behind the shabby but legitimate temple to Limyé that can never quite make room for all its parishioners, is a completely illegal and unregistered soup kitchen. It's much more than that. This is where the desperate and despondent among the students go. There's always food, a blanket, and a place to sleep. Unofficial study groups form here, older students mentoring younger ones, textbooks that are on the verge of falling apart, trade hands, and quiet, comforting prayers delivered by Father Patrick make the moonlight shine a little more comforting as students try to find what comfort they can. There's never enough resources, and despite people pitching in what they can, there are simply more mouths to feed, more unhomed students, more issues than one priest and one temple can handle. No one notices the discreet visits from the athletics department recruiter, other than to thank him for his latest generous donation, and too many people cycle in and out for anyone to notice the occasional missing student. It's a disheartening mix of utter misery and grubby, scrounged hope in the dimmest part of the Mezzanine.</p>

<p><strong>The University of Arcane Magic Enclave:</strong> A looming tower of white marble and gold filigree, a work of art and obvious magic and making sure everyone knows it. The architecture screams Aelfir supremacy. Soaring ceilings designed for their height, narrow servant passages for Drow, inscriptions in old Aelfir script celebrating the Conquest. Every surface is polished to a mirror shine by exhausted Drow custodians. The entrance hall features a massive mural depicting the "civilizing" of the Spire, Aelfir bringing enlightenment to the grateful Drow. Students and faculty are exclusively Aelfir. The entire tower is kept magically cold, and for non-aelfir it's wildly uncomfortable. Monamon's birds have free range on the top floors of the building. The birds are aggressive, territorial, beautiful and cruel. His interns spend hours maintaining the aviary, feeding, cleaning, ensuring the ecosystem thrives. The building has seminar rooms where only Aelfir are allowed, laboratories where dangerous research happens behind locked doors, a quick conduit up to the University of Arcane Magic that is only for approved staff, as it goes through the Vermissian, and a vault that contains secrets that would chill the players even through the everpresent cold.</p>

<p><strong>The Broken Crown:</strong> A dive bar that caters exclusively to students, where watered-down drinks cost what desperate Drow can scrape together. The owner, a former athlete with a mangled leg, doesn't ask questions and looks the other way when revolutionary groups meet in the back booths. It's where you go when the volume of drinks is more important than how watered down they are.</p>

<p><strong>Lecture Hall 7:</strong> The only lecture hall in the prestigious and ancient First-Frost-Of-Winter building with working heating, decent acoustics, and enough seats for a full class. Professors fight viciously over booking it, bribes, blackmail, and office politics all deployed for the privilege. Students know if your class is in Hall 7, your professor has pull. Those not as lucky freeze in hall 4, cram into Hall 12, or have the true misfortune of being in the other halls.</p>

<p><strong>The Gilt Edge Dormitory:</strong> One of the newer dormitories in the campus. Due to a terrible bureaucratic mistake it's double booked. Four drow per room when it was supposed to be two. This will be corrected sometime in the next five years, but the assignments were made and no one can modify them until then. This has led to an explosion of drama, romance and at least three stabbings and one defenestration.</p>

<p><strong>The Cacophony:</strong> An abandoned steam tunnel converted into an underground music venue. Bands play, students dance, revolutionary pamphlets circulate, drugs change hands. The acoustics are terrible and it floods every other week, but its so grungy and requires getting your feet wet, so the Provost Guards are reluctant to raid it. Access changes weekly. You need to know someone who knows someone.</p>

<p><strong>The Silver Chrysanthemum Society:</strong> An exclusive Aelfir student club in a converted mansion, membership by invitation only. Legacy admissions, family connections, the right breeding. They throw elaborate parties, haze new members with "harmless traditions" that occasionally cripple someone, and maintain a network that guarantees post-graduation positions. The building reeks of money, with stained glass windows that cost a small fortune, an entire in-house staff of cooks, and almost nightly extravagant parties. Aurelia is a member and doesn't understand why everyone resents it. Every previous Supreme Adjudicator was a Chrysanthemum alumni.</p>

<p><strong>The Champion's Tribute:</strong> A cramped shop selling chariotball memorabilia: bloodstained jerseys, pieces of shattered chariots, teeth knocked out during famous matches, all mounted and priced for obsessive fans. The walls are covered in portraits of dead athletes, treated like martyrs. Students gather here before games, painting their faces in team colors, buying lucky charms, spending more than they should. Its one of the few places where Aelfir and Drow sometimes rub shoulders. The owner, a former athlete who survived five seasons, narrates famous games with reverence and encyclopedic knowledge. In the back room, the most devoted fans meet, tracking stats, arguing strategies, betting on which freshman will die first this season. They talk about athletes with reverence and enthusiasm bordering on fanaticism. More than one brawl has broken out over the honor of one of the athletes.</p>


<p><strong>Charter Street:</strong> A cobblestone avenue lined with society houses, each building announcing its residents' place in the social hierarchy. At the top of the street, the Silver Chrysanthemum Society occupies a marble mansion with manicured gardens and bronze gates. Moving downward, the houses get smaller, older, more cramped. The Golden Ratio Society operates from a converted townhouse near the bottom, its paint peeling, its members spilling onto the street during gatherings. Each house displays its colors and symbols. Banners hang from windows during Crush Week: the brutal recruitment period when societies compete for promising students. What happens behind those doors during initiation is never discussed publicly, but the infirmary sees a spike in "accidents" every year. The Provost Guards patrol regularly but rarely intervene. Society business is society business. </p>

<div class="ruled-item">
<h3>The People's Theory Collective</h3>
<p>A student revolutionary group that meets in Madame's House basement and rotating safe spaces. Mostly earnest Drow students who've read too much theory and not enough tactics. They publish The Common Truth, an underground newspaper that gets past Ethics Board censors through increasingly creative euphemisms. They organize protests (usually broken up within an hour), distribute banned texts, and recruit from Father Patrick's ministry. They're an ideological hodgepodge that seems to depend on who is currently making the most effective argument. Leadership changes every few months when someone gets arrested or graduates. The Red Baron considers them useful idiots. Valerius considers them convenient scapegoats. Being a student revolutionary group, half the drama is which revolutionary is sleeping with whom and nuanced discussions about how to cheat on exams. Their last victory was a grand display of anti-athletics graffiti they managed to draw on Founders' Hall, which was cleaned up within the day.</p>
</div>

<div class="ruled-item">
<h3>The Golden Ratio Society</h3>
<p>A Drow fraternity that functions as genuine mutual aid: members help each other with rent, tutoring, job connections, textbook sharing. The mentorship is real, the parties are good, and for students with no family wealth, the Society is often how you survive the Conservatory. Membership requires "contributing back to the brotherhood". At first it's reasonable favors, then it escalates. Hold this package. Let someone use your dorm room. Pick something up from the Sturdy Cow. Most members tell themselves this is just networking, everyone does favors, this is how the world works. Some know they're working for the Red Baron. Others are realizing they crossed a line months ago but can't walk away clean. A few genuinely don't know, they just know the Society helped when no one else would. Initiation requires stealing something valuable as proof you're willing to take risks for your brothers.</p>
</div>

<div class="ruled-item">
<h3>The House of Fortunate Wind</h3>
<p>A combination temple, casino, and bookmaker operating in a legal grey area. Officially it's a "prayer house where devotees make offerings to Stolz through games of chance." Practically it's where serious gambling happens. Remy Chiffre works here part-time, running numbers. The temple is run by a cheerful Drow priest who goes by Lucky, who may or may not actually believe in Stolz but definitely believes in taking the house's cut. Students blow their stipends here. Professors bet on grant outcomes. Entire grants are gambled away. During the Blood Moon Championship, the place is packed wall-to-wall. The Provost Guards look the other way. Venmir gets a percentage, and the Red Baron gets a cut from the bookies. Stolz iconography everywhere: dice, wheels, cards. Incense smells like money and desperation.</p>
</div>

<div class="ruled-item">
<h3>The Conservatory Herald</h3>
<p>The official student newspaper, printed on expensive paper, distributed free in every building. It's funded by the Office of Student Affairs and reads like it. Glowing profiles of candidates (Monamon gets two full pages), breathless coverage of Athletics victories, praise for the Solar Pantheon, advice columns about proper academic etiquette. The editorial board is Aurelia and three Crysanthium members. Reading it makes you dumber. Students mock it relentlessly but everyone reads it because they publish the actual hours for important events and scholarship deadlines. The editor is a true believer named Sterling Twice-Blessed-By-Dawn who thinks he's speaking truth to power by occasionally running letters to the editor that mildly criticize cafeteria hours.</p>
</div>



<div class="ruled-item">
<h3>The Ink Beneath</h3>
<p>Not really a newspaper, just a series of anonymous pamphlets that appear overnight, pasted on walls, slipped under doors, left in bathroom stalls. No consistent schedule. Each issue is hand-printed, water-stained, sometimes bloodstained. The writing is sharp, specific, dangerous: it encourages violence, rising against oppression. The author is witty and relatable and the passion in the way they describe the necessary uprising is tangible. The People's Theory Collective wishes they wrote this. They don't. No one knows who does. Some think it's a disgruntled student. Some think it's a collective of service workers. Some think it's one person with a death wish. The Solar Paladins have arrested fourteen people for suspected involvement; none were actually responsible. The ink is literally printed beneath, using a stolen printing press hidden in the passages below the Mezzanine. Issues appear less frequently now.</p>

<h3>The Symposium Club</h3>
<p>A professor's drinking society that meets weekly at a different upscale bar to "discuss matters of academic import." Really it's where departmental politics happen, gossip circulates, and alliances form. Membership is invitation-only, supposedly based on "scholarly achievement" but actually based on who you know. They wear little bronze pins shaped like scrolls. Jakob is a member but never attends. Monamon hosts regularly. Lana occasionally appears to network. The club has elaborate bylaws about speaking order, toast protocols, and who sits where, all designed to reinforce hierarchy while pretending it's a collegial fellowship. They discuss the election constantly, in euphemisms and implications. A young professor desperate for tenure can spend a decade trying to get invited. Adjuncts and junior faculty aren't eligible, which is the point. Venmir is not a member but receives detailed notes from three separate attendees after each meeting.</p>

<div class="ruled-item">
<h3>The Painted Faces</h3>
<p>Loose networks of chariotball fans organized by team loyalty. They coordinate watch parties, maintain player shrines in the Commons, and organize street processions after major victories. When an athlete dies, the Faces pool money for the funeral and make sure someone shows up who knows their name. They know the statistics, the legendary plays, and which referee takes bribes. The Champion's Tribute gives them discount drinks on game days. They have elaborate superstitions: which entrance to use, what to eat before matches, which chants bring luck. Some members are former athletes who survived. Some are students who never played but found belonging in the stands. They argue viciously about roster decisions and coaching strategies. They trade jerseys and lucky charms.</p>
</div>

<div class="ruled-item">
<h3>The Æther Appreciation Society</h3>
<p>Graduate students researching entropy. During the day it's a group of cross-disciplinary graduate students with a shared interest trying to publish a paper or two on the side. But those who are in the know meet at 2 AM in the abandoned cisterns. They bring objects of beauty, or people, the hungry deep doesn't distinguish between the two... and destroy them, in candlelit rituals as they chant. The Hungry Deep rewards them with the ability to inflict entropy, to bring poison and rot, and the society is a rot among the graduate students. Their agenda seems to simply be decay, and to that purpose they dedicate themselves.</p>
</div>

<div class="ruled-item">
<h3>The Crowned Players</h3>
<p>An old, prestigious theater society that believes in the transformative power of performance: to be seen, to be remembered, to achieve immortality through art. Members wear gold pins shaped like crowns. They value spectacle, ambition, and legacy. Their initiations involve performing monologues at dawn, being critiqued publicly, proving you deserve to be seen.  The rivalry with the Mirror Society started seven years ago when a Mirror Society member deliberately wore silver to the Crowned Players' Gold Gala. An obviously calculated insult. The Mirror Society has been insufferable ever since, pretending their petty provocations are "artistic statements." What members don't know: the College of Undying Light identifies promising students through the society and approaches them with offers of real immortality, not just artistic legacy.</p>
</div>

<div class="ruled-item">
<h3>The Mirror Society</h3>
<p>A younger, more experimental theater collective that believes performance is about truth: holding up a mirror to society, to yourself, to hidden realities. They perform in unconventional spaces, push boundaries, and pride themselves on technique over spectacle. Members wear silver pins shaped like hand mirrors. Their initiations involve weeks of observation exercises, method acting that borders on disturbing, demonstrating you can see and reflect truth. They consider themselves the only society doing "real" theater.  The rivalry with the Crowned Players started seven years ago when one of their members stated that the Mirror Society's production of "Stones Weep at Dawn" was "barely theater." The Crowned Players have been insufferably smug ever since, mistaking commercial appeal for artistic merit. What members don't know: the Sisterhood of Illumination identifies students with potential for blood magic and demonology through the society's intense psychological exercises and approaches them with offers of real illumination.</p>

For a minute no sound louder than a whisper may be uttered. Screams emerge as whispers, falling objects clatter as if they'd fallen on cotton sheets, and even gunfire sounds muffled.

<p><span class="ability-name">Wearer of the Veil</span> <span class="ability-tags">[Occult]</span> - When wearing the signature white veil of the librarians, you may pass unimpeded where others would not. Once per session you can simply declare that the guards let you pass, you step out of view and appear on the other side of the door or otherwise gain egress to an area that should be off limits to you. No one finds this weird at all.</p>

For the rest of this scene you count as having the fight skill, and your unarmed attacks deal 1d3 stress. When you successfully inflict stress on someone, you may teleport them up to ten feet away, so long as its into a clear space. You may choose to move with them.</p>
</div>

<div class="ability">
<p><span class="ability-name">Rearrange the Stacks</span> <span class="ability-tags">[Occult]</span> - Mark 1d6 blood stress to cast this spell. Reduce it to 1d3 if you are in the library.

You cannot choose precisely where in the library or the spire it goes and the connection lasts for exactly one minute.</p>

You unshackle and control a fragment of that power. Immediately take 1d8 stress to blood. Channel an unknowable entity, it can answer any question about any NPC that has ever set foot in the library, or about any esoteric knowledge that might be contained in the library. The spirit will answer truthfully and comprehensively. The first question is free, each subsequent one costs 1d6 blood stress. This information can be highly complex, e.g. "how do i disable an Elidon" is a completely valid question. Once you've done the initial ritual you can keep asking questions, in any scene, as long as you pay the cost.</p>

<div class="ability">
<p><span class="ability-name">For Academic Purposes</span> - You can requisition dangerous materials from university collections "for research." Twice per session, you happen to have something restricted or illegal (demonological texts, experimental chemicals, banned artifacts, restricted documents) on your person, and it's just expected. University administration assumes you have legitimate reasons. Guards seeing you brandish a vial of acid might have a different opinion.</p>
</div>

<div class="ability">
<p><span class="ability-name">Publish or Perish</span> - Gain the Compel skill. Once per session when you are arguing about something and you can tie it to your "research", however fictitious or flim-flamy, you can use your reputation to make the opposing party believe you are telling the truth, however outrageous it may be. Of course thinking you're telling the truth and giving you what you want are two different things.</p>
</div>

<div class="ability">
<p><span class="ability-name">Subject Matter Expert</span> - Gain the Academia or Order domain. When dealing with bureaucracy or paperwork, you can use your vast experience navigating grant requests, enrollment forms and various ethics board paperwork to find a way through.

<p><span class="ability-name">Research Assistant</span> - Fellows of course have research assistants, hardy types who really want to please and are absolutely expendable. In any given scene you can declare your research assistants arrive, narrate how they make their entrance. It's always a trio of drow who are well meaning, clueless to your actual activities, eager to be involved in research, and utterly expendable. If they die, next time you invoke this power, it's a different trio of research assistants. Once per session, when you narrate their arrival you can also narrate something they've accomplished for you that would be within their purview and that is useful in the scene, be it setting explosives at the entrances, notifying the guard, or bringing your favorite set of dueling swords. Feel free to name them, but don't grow attached.</p>

</div>

<div class="class-tier">
<h4>Low</h4>
</div>

<div class="ability">
<p><span class="ability-name">Arena-Born</span> - Gain the Fight Skill. You're trained to perform under pressure.

The bigger the crowd, the better you fight.</p>
</div>

<div class="ability">
<p><span class="ability-name">Chariotball-Tough</span> - Gain the Resist Skill. When you roll for Blood or Mind Fallout, if there is an audience, you can choose to push through the pain. Ignore the fallout until the end of the scene, or until the audience vanishes, whichever comes first, at which point you roll for fallout.</p>
</div>

<div class="ability">
<p><span class="ability-name">Fan Favorite</span> - Once per session you may declare that someone recognizes you from your halcyon days competing. Who it is is up to the DM, but you have instant name recognition. Maybe they're a fan, or a fan of a rival team, or a former athlete, but one way or another there's an instant bond… of some kind.</p>
</div>

<div class="ability">
<p><span class="ability-name">Read the Field</span> - +1 Blood. Years of team sports taught you to read movement and predict positions. Once per scene, ask the GM where an opponent will move next or what their tactical plan is. The GM must answer truthfully. This doesn't apply only to combat, though it's of limited utility if there is no plan.</p>
</div>

<div class="ability">

<tr><td>2</td><td><strong>The Chrysanthemum Society's hazing went too far again</strong> - Some freshman's fingers are broken. His family has lodged a complaint. Three members are quietly being "encouraged" to take a semester abroad in Amaranth until it blows over</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td><strong>An Athletics recruiter got beaten half to death in an alley</strong> - Three broken ribs, shattered jaw. He claims he doesn't remember anything. Everyone knows it was someone's brother/friend/lover getting revenge. Provost Guards aren't investigating very hard</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td><strong>That married Galvanics professor is definitely sleeping with her research assistant</strong> - They're not even subtle about it. Her husband teaches in the same building. Everyone's waiting for the inevitable explosion</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td><strong>The visiting scholar from Amaranth wore the wrong mask to the Chancellor's dinner</strong> - Apparently it was deeply inappropriate for the season. She's been socially destroyed. Her family is aghast and at least three different budget meetings have been derailed as a result</td></tr>

<tr><td>8</td><td><strong>The Blood Moon Championship betting pools are getting vicious</strong> - Two bookies got into a knife fight over disputed odds. Lucky at the House of Fortunate Winds is offering suspiciously good returns on athlete death predictions</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td><strong>Monamon's wife showed up to the faculty luncheon</strong> - She and Monamon spent two hours making increasingly cutting remarks at each other. Witnesses report it was "deeply uncomfortable." She called his research "compensatory"</td></tr>

<tr><td>2</td><td><strong>They're being treated for broken ribs from an "athletics scholarship interview"</strong> - They said no. The recruiters were very insistent. Now they're paranoid about leaving their dorm and their friends don't believe them because "why would you turn them down?"</td></tr>

<tr><td>7</td><td><strong>They're rationing their prescription medication to make it last</strong> - It's for chronic pain from an old injury. They can barely afford food, let alone refills. Some days they can't get out of bed. Professors don't accept "pain" as an excuse</td></tr>

<tr><td>3</td><td><strong>"Ask Professor Trent where his research came from"</strong> - Specific, targeted, spreading everywhere. Professor Trent looks increasingly haggard. Could be any professor's name</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td><strong>"How many students bought your new carriage, Provost?"</strong> - Written in elegant script. Cleaned off daily. Reappears nightly. Sometimes names other administrators</td></tr>

<tr><td>2</td><td><strong>Food vendors are doing brisk business</strong> - The smell of fried dough and questionable meat. Students lined up, haggling, stealing from each other's plates. One vendor's cart got knocked over and they're screaming about who's going to pay for the damages</td></tr>

<tr><td>4</td><td><strong>A duel is scheduled for noon</strong> - Word has spread. Students gathering in a loose circle, placing bets, gossiping about what insult was so terrible it required blood. Both duelists are preparing in opposite corners, seconds checking weapons. This is extremely illegal</td></tr>

Three well-dressed drow brothers are smiling, making promises, taking names. They're very interested in students who seem desperate</td></tr>

<tr><td>2</td><td><strong>Lengthy discussion of mask protocols</strong> - Whether the host's choice of silver filigree was appropriate for winter, whether someone's mask was "trying too hard," arcane rules about which families can wear which colors. Deadly serious</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td><strong>"The torture opera at the Crimson Vesper was simply transcendent"</strong> - Three Aelfir debating the soprano's technique during the disembowelment aria, whether the tenor properly conveyed existential suffering, the innovative use of horizontal saws.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td><strong>"I heard she's sleeping with her Drow secretary. Can you imagine?"</strong> - Hushed, scandalized tones. "Her secretary. It's not even as if he's talented." Agreement that it's terribly gauche</td></tr>

<tr><td>2</td><td><strong>"The Librarians already know who's going to win"</strong> - They have access to prophetic texts in the restricted section. Someone's aunt's friend saw Mirena Stillwater marking a specific candidate's name in an ancient ledger bound in red leather</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td><strong>"Lana paid 50,000 for the Brazzacot Institute vote"</strong> - Everyone knows she's absurdly wealthy. The math checks out. Never mind that the Institute chose her for other reasons : this version is simpler and people love repeating the number, which seems to increase all the time</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td><strong>"Theodore isn't actually running, it's an elaborate prank"</strong> - He's too drunk, too unserious. This must be performance art or a bet with his Chrysanthemum friends. Some students are convinced he'll withdraw dramatically at the ceremony and endorse someone else just for the chaos</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td><strong>"Valerius murdered the Supreme Adjudicator"</strong> - He's too quiet, too calm, always in the background. Classic serial killer behavior. Someone's roommate swears they saw him leaving the building that night carrying something heavy.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td><strong>"The Athletics vote is going to whoever promises Amelia a new stadium"</strong> - She doesn't care about politics, just funding for more brutal sports. Offer her enough construction budget and she'll vote for literally anyone. Multiple candidates are supposedly making offers</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td><strong>"Jakob and Lana have a secret alliance"</strong> - They were seen having tea at the House of Hollows last week. Someone overheard them discussing "mutual interests" and "long-term plans." It's obviously a coalition.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td><strong>"The Red Baron is backing all five candidates simultaneously"</strong> - He's hedging his bets, playing all sides. No matter who wins, he wins. People cite this as proof of his genius.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td><strong>"Aurelia already promised her vote to her father in exchange for paying off her friend's debts"</strong> - Despite all her revolutionary posturing, family is family. Everyone knows she'll cave when Monamon applies pressure. The question is just what he had to offer her</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td><strong>"There's an eighth vote hidden in the founding charter"</strong> - Buried in the original Conservatory bylaws somewhere. If you find the right clause and invoke it correctly, you get an extra vote. Students keep sneaking into the archives looking for it.</td></tr>

<tr><td>1</td><td><strong>Nobody knows how to work the stolen printing press</strong> - They've had it for two weeks. Sat through three lectures about its revolutionary importance. Someone's trying to thread it now, getting ink everywhere. Instructions are in a language nobody reads. The pamphlets need to go out tomorrow. Panic is setting in</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td><strong>The theory guy won't shut up</strong> - He's been lecturing for forty minutes about a book nobody else has read. People are trying to discuss actual plans. He keeps interrupting with "well, actually, if you read Volume III..." Someone just threw a pamphlet at his head</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td><strong>Someone's ex just walked in with their new partner</strong> - Both are here to "support the cause." They're being aggressively affectionate. The ex is trying to continue the meeting professionally. It's not working. This room is too small for this</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td><strong>Someone brought alcohol and now it's a party</strong> - Started as a serious meeting. Someone produced a bottle. Now half the group is drunk, someone's crying about their childhood, two people are making out in the corner. The actual revolutionaries are furious but outnumbered</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td><strong>The manifesto is terrible and everyone knows it</strong> - Andres stayed up all night writing it. He's reading it aloud, voice shaking with emotion. It's overwrought, contradictory, and accidentally plagiarizes three different texts. Nobody wants to say anything.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td><strong>Student from a rich Drow family trying to relate</strong> - "I totally understand poverty, my family only has two estates." They paid their way out of their Durance. The working-class students are vibrating with rage. Someone's about to snap</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td><strong>One person has done literally all the work</strong> - Printed the pamphlets, organized the meeting, come up with refreshments. Everyone else just showed up to debate theory. They're having a breakdown. "I can't do this alone anymore." Uncomfortable silence. No one volunteers. Again</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td><strong>Meeting crashed by a different revolutionary group</strong> - Five members of the People's Liberation Front just walked into the Liberation People's Front meeting. They're rivals. Both groups claim this space. Both scheduled for now. Neither will leave. This is getting territorial</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td><strong>Someone's mother just showed up</strong> - Tracked them down, marching in demanding they come home, they have exams tomorrow, this is exactly what she warned about. The revolutionary in question is mortified. Their mother is lecturing everyone about "wasting potential." This is excruciating</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td><strong>The hideout is freezing and everyone's miserable</strong> - Been here three hours, no heat, can see their breath. Someone suggests moving. Someone else insists this is "bourgeois comfort-seeking." People are more focused on not getting frostbite than revolution. Teeth are chattering. This is pointless</td></tr>

<tbody>
<tr><td>1</td><td><strong>"Community Healing Circles"</strong> - Free "therapeutic support groups" for struggling students. Led by her sorority sisters who completed an intensive week-long "Healing Circle Facilitator Training" and are now "certified." Sessions involve sharing your deepest traumas with 30 strangers, then being told to "practice gratitude." Attendance tracked. Students report feeling worse and being gossiped about afterward.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td><strong>"Academic Success Workshops"</strong> - Mandatory workshops on "study strategies" that conflict with most students' work schedules. Topics include "Maximizing Your Private Tutor," "Summer Research Opportunities" , and "Networking at Your Family Estate." Missing sessions affects your academic standing. She attended one and found it "so practical!"</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td><strong>"Drow Heritage Center"</strong> - Converted a large study space into a "cultural celebration room." Decorated with offensive stereotypical art purchased from aelfir artists. Has educational placards about "traditional drow customs" that are completely wrong. Requires booking 3 weeks in advance. Monitored by Ethics Board. "Now drow students have their own space!" Most students avoid it entirely.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td><strong>"Professional Development Wardrobe Initiative"</strong> - Acquired three (3) formal suits for student use. Waitlist is 300+ students deep. The suits are sized for tall aelfir, in styles appropriate for high society events. Students wear them to catering interviews and dishwashing shifts, wildly overdressed and uncomfortable. She thinks they look "so professional!"</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td><strong>"Community Building Mixers"</strong> - Mandatory monthly galas where drow students must attend in formal wear and "network" with wealthy aelfir donors. Students serve as entertainment/inspiration. "It's about building bridges!" Donors treat it like a zoo. Multiple scholarships depend on attendance.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td><strong>"Nutrition Education Series"</strong> - Hired an aelfir nutritionist to teach "healthy eating on a budget." Every recipe requires ingredients that cost more than a semester's tuition. Rare imported fish, herbs from specific Amaranth markets, specialized equipment. "It's so simple!" She attended once and "made" the featured dish. Her family's cook prepared it.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td><strong>"Sleep Wellness Program"</strong> - After learning students work night shifts, she's lobbying to ban overnight work-study positions "for their health." This would eliminate the only employment available to students with daytime classes. Her proposal includes luxury "sleep pods" in the library. No plan for how students will pay rent without night work.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td><strong>"Academic Mentorship Program"</strong> - Paired struggling drow students with "successful" Aelfir alumni mentors. Not a single Aelfir actually volunteered, being paired with drow students is beneath them. The "program" is entirely theoretical. Students are still required to write thank-you notes to their non-existent mentors and submit reflection essays about "what they learned from the experience." She keeps promising mentors will be assigned "next semester."</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td><strong>"Equitable Campus Beautification"</strong> - Planted expensive ornamental gardens throughout campus, including demolishing the free water pump students used. New decorative fountains are non-potable. "The campus looks so inspiring now!" Students now pay for water or walk 20 minutes to the nearest working pump.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td><strong>"Empowerment Through Athletics"</strong> - Partnered with Amelia to create "athletic scholarships for underrepresented students." She genuinely doesn't know it's a pipeline to the Athletics Department's recruitment system. Gives tearful speeches about "transformative opportunities" and "changing lives through sport." Has personally recommended 7 students. When they come back changed (or don't come back), she thinks they "found their calling" or "couldn't handle the commitment." She's never attended a game.</td></tr>

<tr><td>1</td><td><strong>Painting their faces in team colors while chanting drinking songs</strong> - They're friendly, offering to paint yours too. They have a flask. They're trying to recruit you to the pre-game rally.</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td><strong>Starting a brawl with rival fans</strong> - Punches flying, bottles breaking, blood already drawn. Provost Guards are watching from a distance, deciding if it's worth intervening. The fighters are too drunk to notice they're blocking the only exit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td><strong>Defacing a rival team's mural</strong> - Three fans with paint buckets, lookouts posted. They're turning the Golden Ascendants' sun symbol into something obscene. It's actually pretty impressive art.</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td><strong>Carrying an injured fan through the streets</strong> - Their friend got hurt at the last game (or in a fight after, or the pregame rally, or… look, charioteers tend to get hurt, ok?). They're singing their team's anthem while trying to find medical help. They're convinced their friend is fine. Their friend is not fine.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td><strong>Setting up an unauthorized betting pool</strong> - Taking bets on today's game, athlete injuries, anything. They've got a chalkboard, a cashbox, and no fear of Provost Guards. The Red Baron's actual bookies are watching from across the street, and there's an actual gangster with them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td><strong>Performing a "good luck" ritual</strong> - Thirty fans in a circle, chanting, burning something in a barrel. It's half religious, half superstition, fully disruptive. They've blocked traffic. They will not move until the ritual completes. Someone's sacrificing a chicken.</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td><strong>Hunting for a rival team's mascot to steal</strong> - Dead serious about this. They have a plan. It's a terrible plan. They're asking random people if they've seen it. Do they mean the actual team mascot or just someone wearing team colors? They're not clear.</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td><strong>Celebrating a recent victory by smashing everything</strong> - Windows, street lamps, vendors' carts. Pure joy turned destructive. They're not angry, they're ecstatic. This makes them more unpredictable. They're buying rounds for everyone, then throwing the bottles at walls.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td><strong>Recruiting for their team's supporter club</strong> - Aggressive sales pitch, free drinks, instant community. They seem genuine. They are genuine. This is totally not a sting operation by the Provost Guard to crack down on illegal betting. Would you like a friendly wager?</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td><strong>Mourning a dead athlete in the street</strong> - Twenty fans, candles, flowers, someone playing music. A shrine has spontaneously appeared. They're sharing stories, crying, getting angry. There's a huge printed photo of the athlete. Someone just started singing the team song, mournfully.</td></tr>

<h2 id="appendix-3">Appendix 3: Design Notes</h2>
</div>

<div class="spire-section spire-two-column">

<h3>Design Theory</h3>

<p>If you've read this far, you've noticed something crucial. This game is very different from almost any published Spire material. Most published adventures (including the incredible Eidolon Sky and Kings of Silver) are very short, they look to give you just enough material to get off the ground and are generally tightly scoped. They generally flesh out rather than introducing new lore wholesale. Knowledge is Power is… not that. This is a grab bag. I threw every idea I had that felt like it fit, and for every idea that is in here I cut five. The idea is that this is as much inspiration as it is an actual campaign framework. It might not be right for Spire, I'm not sure, but it felt right. I wanted to create a dense, complex web and let GMs take whatever slice from it best suited their table. I wrote the campaign I desperately want to play in. I put in the spirit of dozens of sessions of Spire where I handed players newspaper cutouts of their exploits and saw their eyes light up.</p>

<p>This is not meant to be used in full. It's too much. Just like the dossier you hand the players is too much. It's meant to be a breathing, intimidating thing, and you, as the GM, are meant to make it your own. Even if making it your own means transplanting Lana's plot wholesale to your own game, or just stealing Remmy. Whatever works.</p>

<p>When I started writing this, I made a crucial mistake. I wrote the first two major NPCs, a couple minors and said "Oh you know what would be fun? Making one NPC per Major Arcana!". Readers, do not repeat my hubris. At some point deep into writing Aurelia I saw how much I had left and put the project down for six months.</p>

<h3>Inspiration</h3>

<p>I realize that Spire is a very British flavored game, and that across the pond, the graft of higher education is a slightly different thing, but it should be obvious what I'm lampooning here. The vaunted institutions of higher learning that seem more interested in emailing alumni for huge donations and maintaining a byzantine bureaucracy of loans and graduation requirements than in actual student welfare. If you've ever had to deal with the latter, you know exactly what the Office of Student Affairs is like. The Chariotball culture I've constructed and the actual violence I've seen over undergraduate sports (not to mention actual horrific injuries) are not so far distant from each other that it should be difficult to see where the parallels lie.</p>

<p>The best satire is a dark mirror of reality, and while obviously Spire grotesquely exaggerates aspects of the real world, as does this adventure, it should be a little frightening how little is exaggerated at points. Because these institutions are cold and uncaring. I don't have a solution, it's not a call to action, just a reminder that satire is us laughing to avoid crying. And perhaps a reminder that if you're going to run this you should refresh yourself on the X card and lines and veils.</p>

<h3>On AI</h3>

<p>This was written at an interesting time, when LLM usage is at an all time high, and when it's almost impossible to read something longform without asking "is this AI generated." So to be honest, none of the text is AI generated (with the exception of one prop where I asked claude to re-write the text at two in the morning because I was not getting my tone across). I did have many long conversations with Claude and Gemini where I asked them to identify gaps, to critique ideas, to help me identify what I was missing. What I learned? LLMs are terrible at RPG design. Terrible at writing suggested scenes. Not bad for being a sounding board. And without them, I would have taken 80 years to generate the html for the props i made, instead of merely weeks.</p>

<p>On AI <em>art</em>. I am also not an artist, wherever possible I sourced open source images, which nowadays means 50/50 on if they were AI generated. I also used Gemini extensively to generate images I thought would enhance props or otherwise help. It was like herding cats. You can see the places where I made my own art, like the election vote count flyer, and the chariotball game flyer. It's dire. I would have preferred to pay artists, but given that the expected profit of this project is negative hundreds of hours, it didn't feel like I could justify it.</p>

<p>I don't think I could have made this without AI assistance. Not so much because it let me do things I couldn't (you'd have fewer, worse, props, and they'd all be newspaper articles), but because it accelerated the parts that would have usually just stopped me from finishing. It also meant I bugged fewer people less frequently for copy editing.</p>

<h3>Final Notes</h3>

<p>I made this project because Spire is one of my favorite RPGs of all time. It's weird. It's fun. It's dark. It's funny. It believes in the players while damning the characters. It captures a zeitgeist in a way I just haven't seen other games do it, and it will always have a spot in my heart. This adventure is for you reader, whoever you are. It's free. I don't display ads on this website (and that's a rant for another time). So if you enjoyed reading this, or somehow you managed to play it, or you printed some of the props for your own use, or it inspired you to get a group of people together to play a oneshot of Spire instead of this monstrosity (Life and Soul from Shadow Operations is my personal pick, though House of Leaving in the same book would be very appropriate), then please, shoot me an email, or a tweet, or something and let me know. </p>
