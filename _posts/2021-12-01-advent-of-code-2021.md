## Mathematica

[This repository](https://github.com/HiggstonRainbird/AoC-2021/) stores my [Advent Of Code](http://adventofcode.com/2021/) solutions for 2021, written in Mathematica.  I'm using .wls instead of .m, and trying to make the code somewhat readable as plaintext, but casual Mathematica in general is notebook-heavy, and isn't great to view on GitHub in any format, so it's not perfect.  

Though there's no specific subreddit challenge this year, I also wrote a poem for each day's problem, as shown below.  I tried not to repeat the same rhyme and metre scheme too much (and avoided iambic pentameter sonnets, since I used them as a crutch last year and the year before), but ultimately had to repeat a few by the end.

## Poems

### [Day 1](https://www.adventofcode.com/2021/day/1/): Stalling the Seven Seas

Today, we lost the sleigh keys on the ocean:  
A tragedy we'll need a month to right.  
They're truly lost; we haven't got a notion  
Of where they got to after leaving sight.  
And so from duty verging on devotion  
We'll start our month-long enterprise tonight.  
We certainly won't rummage in slow-motion...  
(...okay, we just like submarines, alright?)  

We'll need a month, at least, to find the keys  
Which, sadly, we misplaced beneath the seas.  

### [Day 2](https://www.adventofcode.com/2021/day/2/): Run Silent, Run Deep

The water here is mighty cold,  
And more pitch black than tar.  
The vales are deep, or so we're told,  
But we have got a star.  
We don't know what day 3 will be,  
Or what errand it tells,  
But our floodlights are green and red.  
Our sonar's jingle bells.  

The challenges we've done before  
Have rarely been a burden.  
(Like inverse `mod`s; I'd like some more  
If I could get a word in).  
It's difficult to cry or pout,  
When we can hear a sleigh,  
And "Silent Night" is sung about  
The Christmas on the way.  

### [Day 3](https://www.adventofcode.com/2021/day/3/): The Power of Two

One and zero: the only components  
Of your hardware, on closer review.  
It can calculate monstrous exponents,  
With transistors that can't count to two.  

With just one piece - the primitive `NOR` gate -  
You can process the bits that pass through:  
Turning `on` for the `off`s at the door gate;  
And for `on`s there, returning `untrue`.  

You can turn `NOR`s to `XOR` gates and `AND`ers,  
And inverters, to name just a few.  
And the multi-bit adder-expanders,  
Are sufficient to build ALUs.  

From these pieces are made all our widgets;  
It's astounding just what they can do.  
You can build a whole world with two digits:  
"On" and "off"; that's the power of two.  

### [Day 4](https://www.adventofcode.com/2021/day/4/): There Was a Sub That Had a Squid

Across and down,  
You count to five;  
You fear to drown,  
But you're alive.  

The squid is big  
Enough to hew,  
Like one small twig  
Your sub in two.  

It wants a show  
And you've the thing  
Which ends in 'o'  
And starts with 'bing'.  

It makes a bet  
And you agree  
(You've racked some debt  
Out here at sea).  

It weighs a ton,  
Your questioned sin:  
Should *it* have fun,  
Or should you *win*?  

You've rigged the boards,  
So now, you think:  
What use rewards  
If then, you sink?  

### [Day 5](https://www.adventofcode.com/2021/day/5/): Crossing a Line

With lines of toxic vents below,  
We make our map, and off we go.  
They're deadly when they intersect  
But we won't cross those lines - we've checked.  

We tidy up our code with `Sign[]`s,  
To handle all the types of lines.  
And then we read the code and scout  
For useless lines, to cross them out.  

And cleaning up the code, we find  
That most of it can be un-lined:  
The hash maps?  Gone.  And same with `Do[]`.  
Non-function lines?  Cross them out too.  

The cleaning's fun, the code is neat,  
But timewise, I've been soundly beat.  
Code fast *and* well?  I'm at a loss;  
That line is always hard to cross.  

### [Day 6](https://www.adventofcode.com/2021/day/6/): Multiply

It glows  
And grows  
Then slows  
In throes.  

Then two fish swim.  
They start out slim  
But things look grim:  
There's four of 'em!  

The school of four fish, swimming past  
Began with one; three more amassed  
And still they're replicating fast  
There's eight; I hope we've seen the last.  

Now, if the lanternfish could die, or if they needed food or clothes,  
Then things might never go awry, if they were limited by those.  
A normal fish will say good-bye, but not (it seems) the fish that glows.  
I'm scared about this school, for I just counted sixteen; still, it grows.  

### [Day 7](https://www.adventofcode.com/2021/day/7/): The Crustacean Supplication

Crabs above whose sea we scuttle  
Give us aid, and not rebuttal,  
Danger comes, surpassing cuttle:  
Blast a hole, and don't be subtle!  

We've made friends with a crustacean  
[Stacking cups while on vacation](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/23),  
[After games of long duration](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/22):  
Save us from this huge cetacean!  

Whales are fast; too late we tracked them.  
Bingo, too, does not distract them.  
Submarines, like ours, attract them:  
Save us, or they'll soon have snacked them!  

Hurry, blast through sheet and shale!  
Wale away, away from whale!  
It's almost here!  We must not fail!  
Grant us weal lest we should wail!  

### [Day 8](https://www.adventofcode.com/2021/day/8/): Constraint Problem

The caves and segments both constrain  
Where we are apt to go,  
And like the tracks that turn a train  
Our course is set, we know.  

Constraints leave but a single route:  
The segments made it clear.  
So since we're stuck until we're out,  
I hope the keys are here.  

### [Day 9](https://www.adventofcode.com/2021/day/9/): Lines Inscribed on a Utilities File

Though we prepare for puzzles there  
Are errors we cannot prevent  
Within the code that we have stowed  
Throughout the year for this event.  

And when we try to re-apply  
These functions that we wrote before,  
The syntax breaks like mica flakes  
And errors fill the screen, and more.  

The cost is sunk (or so we've thunk)  
And wasting `Utils` causes pain,  
So we debug, no longer smug,  
And lose the time we thought to gain.  

But in the end, we do amend  
And make it through this game we play.  
We coders are, to get each star,  
[Like broken clocks](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/8), right twice a day.  

### [Day 10](https://www.adventofcode.com/2021/day/10/): Luck is the Draw

"So you see, we keep score,"  
Said the checker, explaining,  
"It can be a chore,  
But it's quite entertaining."  

I looked back, quite confused,  
At this odd explanation.  
Were they that amused  
By some syntax mutation?  

So said I, in responding,  
"Your scores are all random!  
They're just corresponding  
To letters in tandem!  

In what way is it fun?  
You've no choice in the outcome!  
So I won't say it's 'dumb' -  
But you're smarter without some!"  

It looked taken aback  
When I finished my question,  
Despite my clear lack  
Of a better suggestion.  

And it thought long and hard  
About how to explain it;  
If it gave some canard,  
I'd be sure to disdain it.  

And at last, it was done,  
To explain their desire:  
"You see, if you've won,  
There's some stars you acquire."  

### [Day 11](https://www.adventofcode.com/2021/day/11/): Dumbos

These octopuses aren't so bright, but yet they get to shine,  
And light the caves for miles around when energies align,  
Eventually syncing up, converging by design:  
Their pastimes seem to go an awful lot smoother than mine.  
And so, when yet another piece of submarine should break,  
I envy the dim octopi; machines were a mistake.  

### [Day 12](https://www.adventofcode.com/2021/day/12/): All Roads Lead To Home

Welcome, `DIJKSTRA`, to your quest.  
Journey onwards, if you dare.  
Choose now: south, or east, or west?  
Dangers dwell within: beware!  

Caverns you may visit twice,  
Or more, as heart and path inclines.  
Small caves, one visit must suffice!  
Never twice to those confines.  

Do you seek to leave these caves?  
Reunite with folk and friend?  
Sally forth, and use your saves!  
The passage that you seek is `end`.  

Dare you, `DIJKSTRA`, now to start?

***Sinking Xanadu***

[In Xanadu did Kubla Khan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kubla_Khan),  
A stately pleasure-dome decree.  
Where Alph, the sacred river, ran  
Through caverns measureless to man  
Down to a sunless sea.  

But we have measured now, and well  
We know the routes and paths and ways.  
And long ago, the tunnels fell,  
With mournful noise, as though a knell  
To sound our end of days.  

Hark now!  The final Vespers chime!  
The way from whence you came shall heave.  
Flee to `GW` in time  
Or perish here, like Coleridge's rhyme.  
Leave now, or never leave!

You made it out!  
That Xanadu's  
A tricky route.  

I'm glad you're safe!  
I'm glad you're here!  
That way is gone.  
Won't reappear!  

`nx` is nice,  
Or so I've heard.

There are four different paths to eject.  

You may go to `GW`'s wizard.  
You may go to `SM`'s clever horse.  
Or `pt`, where the siren's call is heard.  
Or `lg`, where the lamprey has force.  

But although your quaint drawing connects us  
There is still one unbreakable rule:  
You can never come back to the NeXus,  
So choose wisely, and don't be a fool.

Threre are three different jugs on the table,  
Which, to pass, you must fill by a reckon.  
Now, the first jug is filled with eight cups' worth,  
But just five cups will fit in the second.  

Now, the third has three cups as its measure,  
But is empty now, just like jug 2.  
So with eight cups' of water between them,  
Here's the puzzle presented to you:  

Via pouring these jugs, move the water,  
So the first jug is half full with four,  
And another four cups in the second,  
And the third must be empty once more.  

Hearing this, do you think you can do it?  
Can you finish before you've turned grey?  
You have journeyed twelve days underwater,  
But I think that much longer you'll stay.  

    > inv

    > scoop water with cup
    You measure out a cup of water - sure enough, you can scoop exactly one cup's worth!
    You begin scooping water from the large jug one cup at a time.
    Soon, you reach the configuration [4, 4, 0].
    
You have cheated!  No fair!  That's illegal!  
I should never have trusted the gnome!  
I can't stop you - the `end` is now open,  
So although you've not earned it - go home!

***End***

Well done, `DIJKSTRA`!  Here's the end.  
Roads are tough, and travels, long.  
Trips like yours will soon be penned:  
Your journey will sound good as song.  

Traveling to every room  
You've kept the rules down to the letter.  
Narrowly avoiding doom  
And every time, returning better.  

Though you've won, if you should want  
To try a slightly harder mode  
In which you can - just once - re-jaunt  
*That* trip would *surely* earn an ode.

And come back to a fresh debut,

Folds to make complex patterns  
Like Christmas snowflakes.  

### [Day 14](https://www.adventofcode.com/2021/day/14/): Confessions of a Polymer Scientist

Long ago, I was free;  
When no chain-links bound me,  
I was filled to the brim with elation.  
But I branched out - alas! -  
To the plastics and glass  
In the realm of polymerization.  

I had dallied, of course,  
With the Circle of Mohr's,  
And with chemistry had a flirtation.  
But I dodged every hook  
'Till I picked up a book:  
"Painter-Coleman: Polymerization".  

When I started this school,  
I thought resins were cool  
Since the heat was not set to "cremation".  
But when temps went ablaze  
I was set in my ways  
By the thermo-polymerization.  

Yes, I've long since been cured  
Of atactic which lured  
Me to radicalize my vocation.  
But, I cannot change gear  
Since I've made my career  
In this field of polymerization.  

I have given some talks  
To Electro-Chem docs:  
They enjoy every graph and citation,  
But the adjuncts are mean:  
"That's spaghetti on screen!"  
When I show them polymerization.  

But there's upsides as well  
To the field where I dwell:  
I don't need Maxwell's stinking equation!  
For my stuff can't conduct  
And electrons get chucked  
Out the door in polymerization.  

There are others out there  
Who I've linked with to share,  
And our network's helped ease the frustration.  
Meeting people like me  
Has increased my degree,  
My degree of polymerization.  

And I've even had fun  
Letting DSC run  
While I'm counting chain ends with titration.  
And in fact, if compared  
To compilers, I'm scared  
Since my program's not spared  
From the errors declared  
Which all must be repaired  
By a man unprepared --  
So I'll stick to polymerization!

You can pathfind to dodge all the critters  
But the coding is not fit for quitters.  
By the time you have won  
When you've got it to run  
I won't blame you for getting the jitters.  

### [Day 16](https://www.adventofcode.com/2021/day/16/): An Ordinary Conversation

"Ahoy!  Is this the submarine?  
Our packets should be nigh.  
Can anybody hear us?  Do you copy?  Please reply!"  

"A scrambled mess was all we got  
Of data clearly hexed.  
Could you be just a bit more clear?  We're all a bit perplexed."  

"A packet's `version` number, then it's  
`Operator`, `ID`,  
Concluded by the subpackets.  It all is rather tidy."  

"And when we've done recursion, while more  
Obstacles befall us?  
Come on and say the matter where you couldn't simply call us!"  

"Any math, we send to you,  
Or else, it'd surely bore us.  
[Class had homework](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/18) overdue we'd hope you'd figure for us..."  

### [Day 17](https://www.adventofcode.com/2021/day/17/): Cast My Words Into The Ocean

*Inspired by /u/CCC_037's solution [in the programming language Rockstar](https://old.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/ri9kdq/2021_day_17_solutions/hovxq0w/).  This is in no way a valid Rockstar program.*

Let my time be not my time.  
Let verses carry thought.  
Cast meaning into poetry.  
Let target be the spot.  

Shatter coords into shreds;  
Cast x into the sky.  
If x stops rolling short of goal  
Then never think of why.  

Rock the system with the x.  
Rock on, and rock again.  
Until the target is surpassed  
Rock on; but roll it then.  

Take the target - why the start  
While target lacks a care?  
Upend the target utterly.  
Why should it finish there?  

Every coord now will soar  
Until the sky is furled.  
Count targets struck by poetry.  
Shout highest.  Shout the world.  

### [Day 18](https://www.adventofcode.com/2021/day/18/): Lazy Limerick #2

There's a new way to finish your mission:  
You must implement snailfish addition.  
There's a `Split[]` and `Explode[]`  
In `Reduce[]` in your code;  
Do it fast, and you'll seem a magician.  

### [Day 19](https://www.adventofcode.com/2021/day/19/): [A Beacon in the Veil of the Night](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjtZWPwGtaY)

How can we travel safely through this cold expanse of night,  
With disconnected beacons as the only source of light?  
The scanners that the probe released don't know their East from West.  
They share a dozen beacons, sometimes; we will do the rest.  

With mirrors, there are forty-eight directions and rotations  
For each potential overlap between a pair of stations.  
For all six faces on the cube, we pick the beacons closest,  
For both beacons, that comes to six times twice a gross (a grossest?).  

Should both the lists of beacons from each scanner be re-sorted,  
Then for one combination, there's a lone difference reported.  
This difference is the offset; all we need to join the patches  
Is check a dozen dozen dozen candidates for matches.  

The order is beyond quadratic; code is beyond slow,  
But patience is enough to make these ocean trenches glow:  
When each and every scanner has another in its sight,  
Then we will fill the murky depths beneath the waves with light.  

### [Day 20](https://www.adventofcode.com/2021/day/20): [Zoom & Enhance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vxq9yj2pVWk)

Hold it.  Run that back, half speed.  
Go forward three more frames.  Advance.  
Right there - that glint is what we need,  
So zoom in there.  Good.  Now, enhance.  

These algorithms reconstruct  
And pierce through graininess and gloom  
That, on first sight seem to obstruct  
A photograph.  Enhance it.  Zoom.  

The glint is a reflection from  
A polished doorknob, and by chance  
The perp just into view had come;  
Uncrop the image, and enhance.  

No luck.  His face still can't be seen.  
'Twas blocked by someone in the room.  
But look!  Those pixels there, in green!  
An eye, an iris!  Pan there!  Zoom!  

We too can see the things she saw  
Reflecting off her forward glance  
I see a nose and upper jaw:  
Enough to find a face.  Enhance.  

Have eigenvalues locked on target?  
Good work.  Bitmap, then resume.  
Our fractal codes (a bit of argot)  
Databased a match. Now, zoom.  

Investigations once depended  
Far too much on cirmustance.  
With these tools, those days have ended.  
Thank you, code!  Now, zoom.  Enhance.  

### [Day 21](https://www.adventofcode.com/2021/day/21): The Garden of Forking Paths

You saw a flower on the left  
Too lovely not to look.  
I drifted rightward, from the heat  
To find a shady nook.  

And from that point our paths diverged  
And separately we strolled  
Throughout the garden of the worlds  
Where trees and dice are gold.  

Each garden path, past vine and root,  
Continues into three,  
But here and there two paths will meet,  
Rejoining from the tree.  

I wander through the many paths,  
And smile at the flowers,  
And pretty things that bring to mind  
Old memories of ours.  

But never do I stop and linger  
Longer than a minute;  
This garden with its endless green  
Has one more flower in it.  

And so I walk the myriad paths  
And roll old Dirac's dice,  
Until we meet, and hand-in-hand  
Can walk through Paradise.  

### [Day 22](https://www.adventofcode.com/2021/day/22): Cube

With length and width and height,  
Complexity is cubic.  
Brute force won't work tonight,  
Much like the cube of Rubik.  

I'll code it up in Rust  
(Mathematica by proxy).  
The leaderboard's a bust.  
My brain is feeling boxy.  

### [Day 23](https://www.adventofcode.com/2021/day/23): Walking Through The Room

*Sung to the tune of [a song by The Police](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbv-LcdLY-Y).*

Tiny steps are what you take  
Walking through the room.  
Don't shuffle a mistake  
Walking through the room.  
Amphipods in hallways  
Walking through the room,  
Can't arrange in all ways  
Walking through,  
Walking through the room.  

Some may say  
"Store `amphi`s in an array."  
No way.  
Got structures to use today!  
Some say  
"Code's too hard, by hand's the way!"  
It may  
But I may as well play.  

Tiny steps are what you take  
Walking through the room.  
5 AM and you're awake  
Walking through the room.  
Amber, Bronze, and Copper  
Walking through the room,  
Get 'em sorted proper  
Walking through,  
Walking through the room.  

Some may say  
"We're not getting keys for sleigh.  
No pay  
If we're not back Christmas Day!"  
Some say  
"Just leave 'em in disarray",  
But nay:  
We may as well play!  

### [Day 24](https://www.adventofcode.com/2021/day/24): Logic

Me and logic parted ways,  
Our friendship at an end,  
For forcing me to think, on days  
That I did not intend.  

Now, though, I have huge arrays,  
And digits to append.  
Logic I won't stop to praise.  
Brute Force, though, *there's* a friend.
