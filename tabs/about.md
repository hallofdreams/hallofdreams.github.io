# What is this?

This is a joint blog between Dave and Felipe. We have a lot of common interests, and things we like to write about. We thought it would be neat to have a central place for these to live, and hopefully a home for interesting discussion.

# Dave

Dave is a materials science engineer, published author, part time philosopher, advent of code leaderboard member and ethical mad genius. 

# Felipe

Is a software developer, site maintainer, machine learning afficionado, pessimist and general philosophical rambler.
